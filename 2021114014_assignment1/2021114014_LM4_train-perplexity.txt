 i stately plump buck mulligan came from the stairhead bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed      2008.1698534786365
 a yellow dressinggown ungirdled was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air      1760.6986907644325
 he held the bowl aloft and intoned introibo ad altare dei      1994.5686514634183
 halted he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely come up kinch      2259.767397770371
 come up you fearful jesuit      1554.8080193928986
 solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest      4741.046724675555
 he faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower the surrounding land and the awaking mountains      1087.6547618435193
 then catching sight of stephen dedalus he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air gurgling in his throat and shaking his head      1897.7685015505197
 stephen dedalus displeased and sleepy leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed him equine in its length and at the light untonsured hair grained and hued like pale oak      2593.36202959411
 buck mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowl smartly      3198.949637197137
 back to barracks      209.23540714928797
 he said sternly      1087.0143600762317
 he added in a preachers tone for this o dearly beloved is the genuine christine body and soul and blood and ouns      1090.6149627327095
 slow music please      855.3894584820848
 shut your eyes gents      1791.3896248460435
 one moment      114.87743334017172
 a little trouble about those white corpuscles      483.11665832582355
 silence all      188.58505817482248
 he peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call then paused awhile in rapt attention his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points      1610.5273777685713
 chrysostomos      16.32330158730159
 that will do nicely      655.7147315121344
 switch off the current will you      1468.016370812331
 he skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher gathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown      1871.7115803424776
 the plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate patron of arts in the middle ages      2552.1556263437847
 a pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips      497.1727509492714
 the mockery of it      2223.899512427845
 he said gaily      1087.0143600762317
 your absurd name an ancient greek      1419.2259129334755
 he pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet laughing to himself      1148.2944120443124
 stephen dedalus stepped up followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck      3003.5799116102266
 buck mulligans gay voice went on      1666.068321836936
 my name is absurd too malachi mulligan two dactyls      824.2358964534277
 but it has a hellenic ring hasnt it      690.9336490730944
 tripping and sunny like the buck himself      1420.3003443755126
 we must go to athens      643.029110847132
 will you come if i can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid      1657.6668272790102
 he laid the brush aside and laughing with delight cried will he come      764.7067928096685
 the jejune jesuit      1316.8241189325138
 ceasing he began to shave with care      1042.476685061697
 tell me mulligan stephen said quietly      1579.1973939450672
 yes my love      1553.0933047558858
 how long is haines going to stay in this tower      1404.6004669973818
 god isnt he dreadful      1591.2581252917241
 a ponderous saxon      25.184431427451194
 he thinks youre not a gentleman      1306.0548462811873
 god these bloody english      1591.2581252917241
 bursting with money and indigestion      3107.2632510982394
 because he comes from oxford      1127.0338621211743
 you know dedalus you have the real oxford manner      2326.1286934988607
 he cant make you out      726.7312662180573
 he shaved warily over his chin      1014.2098097969771
 he was raving all night about a black panther stephen said      827.3469651146908
 where is his guncase      1968.307428558107
 a woful lunatic      25.184431427451194
 mulligan said      252.1600697633723
 were you in a funk      3051.3974844883123
 i was stephen said with energy and growing fear      338.5520425218673
 out here in the dark with a man i dont know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a black panther      1701.5799946840013
 you saved men from drowning      778.5609691844301
 im not a hero however      369.07348056699897
 if he stays on here i am off      472.8153524460093
 buck mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade      3160.5310449040817
 he hopped down from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily      1935.7343868068222
 scutter      16.32330158730159
 he cried thickly      1087.0143600762317
 he came over to the gunrest and thrusting a hand into stephens upper pocket said lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor      2147.949438473494
 stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a dirty crumpled handkerchief      4022.9071146887477
 buck mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly      1666.068321836936
 then gazing over the handkerchief he said the bards noserag      790.7241778341551
 a new art colour for our irish poets snotgreen      444.36283336000815
 you can almost taste it cant you      744.5194239210439
 he mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over dublin bay his fair oakpale hair stirring slightly      2297.2017563002833
 god      16.32330158730159
 he said quietly      1087.0143600762317
 isnt the sea what algy calls it a great sweet mother      1182.2107738520592
 the snotgreen sea      1316.8241189325138
 the scrotumtightening sea      1316.8241189325138
 epi oinopa ponton      975.3184839030737
 ah dedalus the greeks      123.76895992302904
 i must teach you      104.63380973792432
 you must read them in the original      1564.2722135456866
 thalatta      16.32330158730159
 thalatta      16.32330158730159
 she is our great sweet mother      494.2529225285422
 come and look      524.7639939839336
 stephen stood up and went over to the parapet      2708.8480061728
 our mighty mother      589.1546035736189
 he turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to stephens face      1989.1112872388285
 the aunt thinks you killed your mother he said      1826.8274767625978
 thats why she wont let me have anything to do with you      1458.9200651493056
 someone killed her stephen said gloomily      1296.1119743533923
 you could have knelt down damn it kinch when your dying mother asked you buck mulligan said      1773.216578357287
 im hyperborean as much as you      650.0488535036576
 but to think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for her      1509.6968590444822
 and you refused      303.49031291261514
 there is something sinister in you      4301.357677609543
 he broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek      1518.3240808268
 but a lovely mummer      2580.1241774955615
 he murmured to himself      434.0085591113503
 kinch the loveliest mummer of them all      1202.482477249386
 he shaved evenly and with care in silence seriously      1458.9493437682677
 stephen an elbow rested on the jagged granite leaned his palm against his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coatsleeve      2411.2552480747895
 pain that was not yet the pain of love fretted his heart      730.2811523725177
 silently in a dream she had come to him after her death her wasted body within its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood her breath that had bent upon him mute reproachful a faint odour of wetted ashes      1069.4481272846342
 across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him      1951.9277118574446
 the ring of bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid      1250.132973727448
 a bowl of white china had stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting      943.2483303603522
 buck mulligan wiped again his razorblade      1666.068321836936
 ah poor dogsbody      192.99067352324482
 he said in a kind voice      426.2510503291903
 i must give you a shirt and a few noserags      709.6235755870846
 how are the secondhand breeks      561.322866895034
 they fit well enough stephen answered      1752.3232127051951
 buck mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip      2536.5007923101643
 the mockery of it he said contentedly      1229.8576941760832
 secondleg they should be      1370.6954251530522
 god knows what poxy bowsy left them off      1776.9934333080016
 i have a lovely pair with a hair stripe grey      210.16649915615957
 youll look spiffing in them      2762.594438854641
 im not joking kinch      124.43127101018061
 you look damn well when youre dressed      1229.4940863194017
 thanks stephen said      1316.8241189325138
 i cant wear them if they are grey      340.18834660513033
 he cant wear them buck mulligan told his face in the mirror      990.0421274786208
 etiquette is etiquette      1121.0366703528418
 he kills his mother but he cant wear grey trousers      1092.469060121927
 he folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the smooth skin      1234.0147938388427
 stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its smokeblue mobile eyes      4111.089063022468
 that fellow i was with in the ship last night said buck mulligan says you have g      995.3588468017701
 i      16.32330158730159
 hes up in dottyville with connolly norman      1524.167851237548
 general paralysis of the insane      4103.829595745591
 he swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea      1612.3416427739744
 his curling shaven lips laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth      1639.3276952214733
 laughter seized all his strong wellknit trunk      3084.832785096212
 look at yourself he said you dreadful bard      824.2953671162876
 stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him cleft by a crooked crack      3580.572951887927
 hair on end      213.32167721622653
 as he and others see me      416.8769724169784
 who chose this face for me      826.3358988174908
 this dogsbody to rid of vermin      574.491574019978
 it asks me too      155.58745613585936
 i pinched it out of the skivvys room buck mulligan said      884.9187758809032
 it does her all right      325.8671672391179
 the aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for malachi      1486.1721791264592
 lead him not into temptation      1004.2366493839094
 and her name is ursula      340.51279755904613
 laughing again he brought the mirror away from stephens peering eyes      1367.569416638103
 the rage of caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror he said      1261.0249618701841
 if wilde were only alive to see you      731.4757497271713
 drawing back and pointing stephen said with bitterness it is a symbol of irish art      1022.8253713552057
 the cracked lookingglass of a servant      1252.4796264619663
 buck mulligan suddenly linked his arm in stephens and walked with him round the tower his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he had thrust them      3660.488096091999
 its not fair to tease you like that kinch is it      695.3204953667944
 he said kindly      1087.0143600762317
 god knows you have more spirit than any of them      2281.0924369016875
 parried again      319.9310234990272
 he fears the lancet of my art as i fear that of his      1696.4871340364646
 the cold steel pen      2223.899512427845
 cracked lookingglass of a servant      1118.2699059675779
 tell that to the oxy chap downstairs and touch him for a guinea      1730.1789461692968
 hes stinking with money and thinks youre not a gentleman      1861.524000815514
 his old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to zulus or some bloody swindle or other      1406.0220939796486
 god kinch if you and i could only work together we might do something for the island      1463.323078525645
 hellenise it      346.26951731202263
 cranlys arm      305.38100980332894
 his arm      346.26951731202263
 and to think of your having to beg from these swine      758.3736719953308
 why dont you trust me more      1519.1327878048294
 what have you up your nose against me      647.918791280381
 is it haines      160.14523668663173
 if he makes any noise here ill bring down seymour and well give him a ragging worse than they gave clive kempthorpe      1023.576562773057
 young shouts of moneyed voices in clive kempthorpes rooms      2862.127958887108
 palefaces they hold their ribs with laughter one clasping another      1815.514464856774
 o i shall expire      75.17511611216402
 break the news to her gently aubrey      1056.9943990802633
 i shall die      31.33630907356715
 with slit ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the table with trousers down at heels chased by ades of magdalen with the tailors shears      1280.4084452104862
 a scared calfs face gilded with marmalade      348.58590250969434
 i dont want to be debagged      469.74004964966747
 shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle      2455.642147351969
 a deaf gardener aproned masked with matthew arnolds face pushes his mower on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms      1684.4481281111373
 to ourselves      394.2451884054323
 new paganism      682.8526969577732
 omphalos      16.32330158730159
 let him stay stephen said      966.7887696465347
 buck mulligan asked impatiently      2270.7975709982443
 cough it up      524.7639939839336
 im quite frank with you      434.05957826501526
 what have you against me now      611.3800648384513
 they halted looking towards the blunt cape of bray head that lay on the water like the snout of a sleeping whale      2482.9661204972404
 stephen freed his arm quietly      2363.684247422802
 do you wish me to tell you      1083.0676540237037
 he asked      346.26951731202263
 yes what is it      1927.8339833327163
 buck mulligan answered      1325.1627305873783
 i dont remember anything      117.85881170333587
 he looked in stephens face as he spoke      1494.3010457251528
 a light wind passed his brow fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of anxiety in his eyes      991.6060479158639
 stephen depressed by his own voice said do you remember the first day i went to your house after my mothers death      3401.957603944331
 buck mulligan frowned quickly and said what      1880.987563323341
 where      16.32330158730159
 i cant remember anything      115.14760088084721
 i remember only ideas and sensations      560.5875867003134
 why      16.32330158730159
 what happened in the name of god      872.0782426652177
 you were making tea stephen said and went across the landing to get more hot water      2101.6903367743707
 your mother and some visitor came out of the drawingroom      2532.439271237825
 she asked you who was in your room      911.574797634187
 what did i say      580.3536400083609
 i forget      40.07546579803417
 you said stephen answered o its only dedalus whose mother is beastly dead      958.5704031569685
 a flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to buck mulligans cheek      1118.8657279320491
 did i say that      586.8352985581349
 he asked      346.26951731202263
 well      16.32330158730159
 what harm is that      580.3536400083609
 he shook his constraint from him nervously      1084.090324939426
 and what is death he asked your mothers or yours or my own      497.8089845899235
 you saw only your mother die      924.2262143148745
 i see them pop off every day in the mater and richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom      985.453366658156
 its a beastly thing and nothing else      157.41070835273388
 it simply doesnt matter      155.58745613585936
 you wouldnt kneel down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you      3513.3864986809363
 why      16.32330158730159
 because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you only its injected the wrong way      1479.616450696101
 to me its all a mockery and beastly      403.38529579747075
 her cerebral lobes are not functioning      1340.0444774847633

 he had spoken himself into boldness      525.6722163241989
 stephen shielding the gaping wounds which the words had left in his heart said very coldly i am not thinking of the offence to my mother      2723.557096463575
 of what then      574.2328371330103
 buck mulligan asked      1325.1627305873783
 of the offence to me stephen answered      1353.8515006454777
 buck mulligan swung round on his heel      1880.987563323341
 o an impossible person      60.20720020283907
 he exclaimed      346.26951731202263
 he walked off quickly round the parapet      809.7269165963794
 stephen stood at his post gazing over the calm sea towards the headland      2788.0772261986203
 sea and headland now grew dim      170.39379809855245
 a voice within the tower called loudly are you up there mulligan      626.4913340857049

 the sassenach wants his morning rashers      1066.577508394794
 his head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase level with the roof dont mope over it all day he said      969.9813081222032
 im inconsequent      40.07546579803417
 give up the moody brooding      1859.7207790372513
 his head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of the stairhead and no more turn aside and brood upon loves bitter mystery for fergus rules the brazen cars      1893.5762595882115
 woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the stairhead seaward where he gazed      2148.6243133831567
 inshore and farther out the mirror of water whitened spurned by lightshod hurrying feet      1313.3401725636452
 white breast of the dim sea      1791.0553455144573
 the twining stresses two by two      1363.783594134749
 a hand plucking the harpstrings merging their twining chords      420.6847435671733
 wavewhite wedded words shimmering on the dim tide      1715.5286705610956
 a cloud began to cover the sun slowly wholly shadowing the bay in deeper green      1059.522526782237
 it lay beneath him a bowl of bitter waters      574.5608464494752
 fergus song i sang it alone in the house holding down the long dark chords      1604.335727371468
 her door was open she wanted to hear my music      1302.6899146849964
 silent with awe and pity i went to her bedside      1296.1043659178222
 she was crying in her wretched bed      684.0598385480954
 for those words stephen loves bitter mystery      1557.4844047553042
 where now      356.60819054830694
 her secrets old featherfans tasselled dancecards powdered with musk a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer      2446.4047500075485
 a birdcage hung in the sunny window of her house when she was a girl      1507.9185982345427
 she heard old royce sing in the pantomime of turko the terrible and laughed with others when he sang i am the boy that can enjoy invisibility      1498.9153038609059
 phantasmal mirth folded away muskperfumed      1345.7815972520525
 folded away in the memory of nature with her toys      1458.4233886536588
 memories beset his brooding brain      1486.5826829738203
 her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had approached the sacrament      1130.4556922719378
 a cored apple filled with brown sugar roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening      1106.4953333001324
 her shapely fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the childrens shirts      2256.686984352759
 in a dream silently she had come to him her wasted body within its loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood her breath bent over him with mute secret words a faint odour of wetted ashes      1147.0290260279314
 her glazing eyes staring out of death to shake and bend my soul      1076.0471454524095
 on me alone      828.1870626114882
 the ghostcandle to light her agony      1637.8181170591708
 ghostly light on the tortured face      2902.0020498231247
 her eyes on me to strike me down      2603.1177607222103

 no mother      682.8526969577732
 kinch ahoy      458.0715147049934
 buck mulligans voice sang from within the tower      2536.5007923101643
 it came nearer up the staircase calling again      596.6098492942043
 stephen still trembling at his souls cry heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words      3312.233668525033
 dedalus come down like a good mosey      2296.831201895729

 his head disappeared and reappeared      285.2262139119514

 well have a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids      2130.171252262869
 four omnipotent sovereigns      609.287474853963
 he flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs singing out of tune with a cockney accent o wont we have a merry time drinking whisky beer and wine      1635.8423698345623
 on coronation coronation day      310.3118301099595
 o wont we have a merry time on coronation day      1098.9214453262073
 warm sunshine merrying over the sea      588.5009500713636
 the nickel shavingbowl shone forgotten on the parapet      1374.436559974393
 why should i bring it down      1273.735868910241
 or leave it there all day forgotten friendship      1187.88605294484
 he went over to it held it in his hands awhile feeling its coolness smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck      1485.967442810729
 so i carried the boat of incense then at clongowes      482.5364376004104
 i am another now and yet the same      158.66883625316865
 a servant too      25.184431427451194
 a server of a servant      204.4557761607075
 in the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower buck mulligans gowned form moved briskly to and fro about the hearth hiding and revealing its yellow glow      1921.0337652075325
 two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor from the high barbacans and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated turning      1995.5384542062372
 well be choked buck mulligan said      1455.7549200612546
 haines open that door will you      795.8110701209856
 stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker      3725.054416671768
 a tall figure rose from the hammock where it had been sitting went to the doorway and pulled open the inner doors      1468.2717700413957
 a voice asked      25.184431427451194

 janey mack im choked      756.0057446049952

 its in the lock stephen said coming forward      327.32496498999154
 the key scraped round harshly twice and when the heavy door had been set ajar welcome light and bright air entered      2912.725259941661
 haines stood at the doorway looking out      990.6839014711009
 stephen haled his upended valise to the table and sat down to wait      2809.760305181882
 buck mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him      2881.485136880192
 then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table set them down heavily and sighed with relief      1769.0808322200137
 im melting he said as the candle remarked when      941.7170497630232

 stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from the locker      4861.430310827178
 buck mulligan sat down in a sudden pet      2536.5007923101643
 what sort of a kip is this      733.0835204524982
 he said      346.26951731202263

 the blessings of god on you      1312.3799986964746

 here i cant go fumbling at the damned eggs      773.3485450501763
 he hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three plates saying in nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti      2713.6072290195743
 haines sat down to pour out the tea      643.2244464717838

 but i say mulligan you do make strong tea dont you      531.4453644562625
 buck mulligan hewing thick slices from the loaf said in an old womans wheedling voice when i makes tea i makes tea as old mother grogan said      2922.4244391346815
 and when i makes water i makes water      1196.8200725863771

 begob maam says mrs cahill god send you dont make them in the one pot      961.5316393424433
 he lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread impaled on his knife      2672.777404173746
 thats folk he said very earnestly for your book haines      1525.2354133015801
 five lines of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of dundrum      1388.9674937203754
 printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind      2016.943998485762
 he turned to stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice lifting his brows can you recall brother is mother grogans tea and water pot spoken of in the mabinogion or is it in the upanishads      1590.294747753583
 i doubt it said stephen gravely      396.19410207499504

 buck mulligan said in the same tone      1880.987563323341
 your reasons pray      826.9303276571115
 i fancy stephen said as he ate it did not exist in or out of the mabinogion      1611.3414872350018
 mother grogan was one imagines a kinswoman of mary ann      3257.492715448314
 buck mulligans face smiled with delight      1666.068321836936
 charming      16.32330158730159
 he said in a finical sweet voice showing his white teeth and blinking his eyes pleasantly      324.24643950304676
 do you think she was      587.132142623087
 quite charming      1024.2790454366598
 then suddenly overclouding all his features he growled in a hoarsened rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf for old mary ann she doesnt care a damn      3953.04469823121
 but hising up her petticoats      1076.6637392816992
 he crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned      1712.0005045010223
 the doorway was darkened by an entering form      1267.8581636739586
 the milk sir      1316.8241189325138

 an old woman came forward and stood by stephens elbow      660.4644278845108
 thats a lovely morning sir she said      862.6123495084448
 glory be to god      1878.828473521875

 mulligan said glancing at her      3379.795685283086
 ah to be sure      123.76895992302904
 stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker      3198.8050975213705
 the islanders mulligan said to haines casually speak frequently of the collector of prepuces      2188.992420118905
 how much sir      578.770855680889
 asked the old woman      478.74035761426114
 a quart stephen said      179.00132913792717
 he watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white milk not hers      1875.6454537309744
 old shrunken paps      567.313695516368
 she poured again a measureful and a tilly      1453.7902675009989
 old and secret she had entered from a morning world maybe a messenger      1502.3275404835977
 she praised the goodness of the milk pouring it out      963.05142964301
 crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field a witch on her toadstool her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs      1583.3932311960305
 they lowed about her whom they knew dewsilky cattle      2578.927172069528
 silk of the kine and poor old woman names given her in old times      1186.8381306590386
 a wandering crone lowly form of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer their common cuckquean a messenger from the secret morning      2277.8914420652686
 to serve or to upbraid whether he could not tell but scorned to beg her favour      1148.117153255451

 he drank at her bidding      740.3883502995898
 if we could live on good food like that he said to her somewhat loudly we wouldnt have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten guts      1306.614409544132
 living in a bogswamp eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust horsedung and consumptives spits      948.8310342064044

 the old woman asked      2223.899512427845

 look at that now she said      848.5802866000496
 stephen listened in scornful silence      2363.684247422802
 she bows her old head to a voice that speaks to her loudly her bonesetter her medicineman me she slights      1688.964272671634
 to the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there is of her but her womans unclean loins of mans flesh made not in gods likeness the serpents prey      1359.0276003338367
 and to the loud voice that now bids her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes      1205.5431835332404
 do you understand what he says      695.1232053841211
 stephen asked her      865.8220654284644
 the old woman said to haines      904.1383743901066
 haines spoke to her again a longer speech confidently      736.6040442432262
 irish buck mulligan said      269.79424531852965

 haines said to her have you your bill      643.2244464717838

 stephen filled again the three cups      3123.7421049642535

 buck mulligan sighed and having filled his mouth with a crust thickly buttered on both sides stretched forth his legs and began to search his trouser pockets      2034.7503280340584
 pay up and look pleasant haines said to him smiling      843.2925487399539
 stephen filled a third cup a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thick rich milk      3672.337589837704
 buck mulligan brought up a florin twisted it round in his fingers and cried a miracle      2427.1414138615455
 he passed it along the table towards the old woman saying ask nothing more of me sweet      791.8275029139231
 all i can give you i give      193.4927594232358
 stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand      5131.941728789947
 well owe twopence he said      3111.2744305896904
 time enough sir she said taking the coin      1345.0751153680994
 time enough      394.2451884054323
 good morning sir      878.7445988018139
 she curtseyed and went out followed by buck mulligans tender chant heart of my heart were it more more would be laid at your feet      2504.827793404755
 he turned to stephen and said seriously dedalus      3212.3830708547835
 im stony      40.07546579803417
 hurry out to your school kip and bring us back some money      2775.274800514162
 today the bards must drink and junket      937.6559220457351
 ireland expects that every man this day will do his duty      1769.4978663938566
 that reminds me haines said rising that i have to visit your national library today      1673.5805193716628
 our swim first buck mulligan said      863.8328974305355
 he turned to stephen and asked blandly is this the day for your monthly wash kinch      2176.4408775307215
 then he said to haines the unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month      1072.3661014457177
 all ireland is washed by the gulfstream stephen said as he let honey trickle over a slice of the loaf      906.4780766339818
 haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke i intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me      2204.629044466932
 speaking to me      753.2780028665163
 they wash and tub and scrub      1752.3232127051951
 agenbite of inwit      303.49031291261514
 conscience      16.32330158730159
 yet heres a spot      2787.399337053142
 that one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol of irish art is deuced good      1394.3242382956014
 buck mulligan kicked stephens foot under the table and said with warmth of tone wait till you hear him on hamlet haines      2403.0038518012257
 well i mean it haines said still speaking to stephen      971.4684638228691
 i was just thinking of it when that poor old creature came in      624.1775837303269
 would i make any money by it      1463.4171224603585
 stephen asked      188.58505817482248
 haines laughed and as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of the hammock said i dont know im sure      1162.1045531684754
 he strolled out to the doorway      1059.0387559527137
 buck mulligan bent across to stephen and said with coarse vigour you put your hoof in it now      3097.393715688991
 what did you say that for      611.3800648384513
 well      16.32330158730159
 stephen said      188.58505817482248
 the problem is to get money      1272.063465657095
 from whom      394.2451884054323
 from the milkwoman or from him      1036.2412495258122
 its a toss up i think      215.10457761979137
 i blow him out about you buck mulligan said and then you come along with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes      963.405039826788
 i see little hope stephen said from her or from him      781.3538991527215
 buck mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on stephens arm      2881.485136880192
 from me kinch he said      2069.1189174464816
 in a suddenly changed tone he added to tell you the gods truth i think youre right      1594.5414542425783
 damn all else they are good for      433.72743572625484
 why dont you play them as i do      2261.5644354300916
 let us get out of the kip      1680.4853359730923
 he stood up gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown saying resignedly mulligan is stripped of his garments      2196.4141315544066
 he emptied his pockets on to the table      2000.4416843999097
 theres your snotrag he said      3583.861393884758
 and putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them chiding them and to his dangling watchchain      1233.7534900676912
 his hands plunged and rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief      1778.8457440211985
 god well simply have to dress the character      1890.0648215606107
 i want puce gloves and green boots      479.916646930661
 contradiction      16.32330158730159
 do i contradict myself      238.88726126360288
 very well then i contradict myself      2241.010494149351
 mercurial malachi      252.1600697633723
 a limp black missile flew out of his talking hands      598.4717634224888
 and theres your latin quarter hat he said      1272.1548513193313
 stephen picked it up and put it on      5131.941728789947
 haines called to them from the doorway are you coming you fellows      1103.0186939457064
 im ready buck mulligan answered going towards the door      1053.5869110265996
 come out kinch      524.7639939839336
 you have eaten all we left i suppose      1346.33744885801
 resigned he passed out with grave words and gait saying wellnigh with sorrow and going forth he met butterly      2277.104566780783
 stephen taking his ashplant from its leaningplace followed them out and as they went down the ladder pulled to the slow iron door and locked it      1752.6855005934433
 he put the huge key in his inner pocket      1418.2761641116144
 at the foot of the ladder buck mulligan asked did you bring the key      877.6942132023421
 i have it stephen said preceding them      483.97478043907535
 he walked on      1087.0143600762317
 behind him he heard buck mulligan club with his heavy bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses      1229.3896531707849
 down sir      319.9310234990272
 how dare you sir      1228.2622447646763
 haines asked do you pay rent for this tower      473.0479866009834
 twelve quid buck mulligan said      3133.9868745477015
 to the secretary of state for war stephen added over his shoulder      1950.3649225210352
 martello you call it      574.4401433084794
 billy pitt had them built buck mulligan said when the french were on the sea      1445.0452403693614
 but ours is the omphalos      1076.6637392816992
 what is your idea of hamlet      611.3800648384513
 haines asked stephen      213.32167721622653
 no no buck mulligan shouted in pain      472.61906495599936
 im not equal to thomas aquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up      1039.648808602254
 wait till i have a few pints in me first      828.4223389931708
 he turned to stephen saying as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his primrose waistcoat you couldnt manage it under three pints kinch could you      2384.2561759972355
 it has waited so long stephen said listlessly it can wait longer      416.30895757357865
 you pique my curiosity haines said amiably      843.0019916047428
 is it some paradox      106.46924341139203
 pooh      16.32330158730159
 we have grown out of wilde and paradoxes      1243.1628328115212
 its quite simple      261.83042261321026
 he proves by algebra that hamlets grandson is shakespeares grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own father      2262.785143041707
 haines said beginning to point at stephen      990.6839014711009
 he himself      346.26951731202263
 buck mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and bending in loose laughter said to stephens ear o shade of kinch the elder      2719.6626972746003
 japhet in search of a father      1638.4317151706143
 were always tired in the morning stephen said to haines      1142.992696616077
 and it is rather long to tell      469.5726427372251
 buck mulligan walking forward again raised his hands      2536.5007923101643
 the sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of dedalus he said      1438.5527776466747
 i mean to say haines explained to stephen as they followed this tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of elsinore      602.5705975102005
 that beetles oer his base into the sea isnt it      1979.3316725087698
 buck mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards stephen but did not speak      2622.69608975291
 in the bright silent instant stephen saw his own image in cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires      1513.1928912065832
 its a wonderful tale haines said bringing them to halt again      629.0830501502816
 eyes pale as the sea the wind had freshened paler firm and prudent      991.5711222400498
 the seas ruler he gazed southward over the bay empty save for the smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tacking by the muglins      1595.875915172846
 i read a theological interpretation of it somewhere he said bemused      294.7302976874566
 the father and the son idea      1363.783594134749
 the son striving to be atoned with the father      1053.8169031267205
 buck mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face      2881.485136880192
 he looked at them his wellshaped mouth open happily his eyes from which he had suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense blinking with mad gaiety      1283.5202972512254
 he moved a dolls head to and fro the brims of his panama hat quivering and began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice im the queerest young fellow that ever you heard      1084.8065766029051
 my mothers a jew my fathers a bird      1815.6249559077412
 with joseph the joiner i cannot agree      855.68925625438
 so heres to disciples and calvary      688.6518370739482
 he held up a forefinger of warning      1713.5631939540924
 if anyone thinks that i amnt divine hell get no free drinks when im making the wine but have to drink water and wish it were plain that i make when the wine becomes water again      1296.6486808211673
 he tugged swiftly at stephens ashplant in farewell and running forward to a brow of the cliff fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or wings of one about to rise in the air and chanted goodbye now goodbye      2551.3203062432863
 write down all i said and tell tom dick and harry i rose from the dead      1257.245657395796
 whats bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly and olivets breezy      1215.2872889588787
 goodbye now goodbye      878.7445988018139
 he capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole fluttering his winglike hands leaping nimbly mercurys hat quivering in the fresh wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries      2411.0942777843784
 haines who had been laughing guardedly walked on beside stephen and said we oughtnt to laugh i suppose      1043.2442580636389
 hes rather blasphemous      1087.0143600762317
 im not a believer myself that is to say      361.32709079142165
 still his gaiety takes the harm out of it somehow doesnt it      1087.1675463512602
 what did he call it      1098.5148401958866
 joseph the joiner      425.63282274081405
 the ballad of joking jesus stephen answered      870.632894468905
 o haines said you have heard it before      516.3270656033485
 three times a day after meals stephen said drily      2055.708940447119
 youre not a believer are you      3727.27485016474
 haines asked      346.26951731202263
 i mean a believer in the narrow sense of the word      264.83212930301437
 creation from nothing and miracles and a personal god      1813.6788168247936
 haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a green stone      1926.2077023213478
 he sprang it open with his thumb and offered it      2161.4504484599197
 thank you stephen said taking a cigarette      1185.0420688406139
 haines helped himself and snapped the case to      643.2244464717838
 he put it back in his sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox sprang it open too and having lit his cigarette held the flaming spunk towards stephen in the shell of his hands      1227.9624071394796
 yes of course he said as they went on again      1026.8934362519583
 either you believe or you dont isnt it      1456.065877692431
 personally i couldnt stomach that idea of a personal god      3036.945925634982
 you dont stand for that i suppose      1127.7720430349661
 you behold in me stephen said with grim displeasure a horrible example of free thought      1363.0752434103488
 he walked on waiting to be spoken to trailing his ashplant by his side      1177.8836027904888
 its ferrule followed lightly on the path squealing at his heels      2712.902822591397
 my familiar after me calling steeeeeeeeeeeephen      628.6302607516415
 a wavering line along the path      279.76712595109416
 they will walk on it tonight coming here in the dark      1629.5033185317732
 he wants that key      434.0085591113503
 it is mine      261.83042261321026
 i paid the rent      117.85881170333587
 now i eat his salt bread      469.13884496235823
 give him the key too      1859.7207790372513
 all      16.32330158730159
 he will ask for it      773.2386609321836
 that was in his eyes      1211.221889176475
 after all haines began      632.1609097221582
 stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not all unkind      3964.632241195149
 after all i should think you are able to free yourself      929.1279473247481
 you are your own master it seems to me      747.0647671824856
 i am a servant of two masters stephen said an english and an italian      458.62323168615825
 italian      16.32330158730159
 haines said      346.26951731202263
 a crazy queen old and jealous      242.28057684026825
 kneel down before me      2830.7237361560187
 and a third stephen said there is who wants me for odd jobs      570.4336939668761
 italian      16.32330158730159
 haines said again      213.32167721622653
 what do you mean      580.3536400083609
 the imperial british state stephen answered his colour rising and the holy roman catholic and apostolic church      1391.1134802956224
 haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he spoke      1061.8285790955485
 i can quite understand that he said calmly      396.0533167204624
 an irishman must think like that i daresay      373.5027196165535
 we feel in england that we have treated you rather unfairly      1396.1933623235382
 it seems history is to blame      485.5677098751564
 the proud potent titles clanged over stephens memory the triumph of their brazen bells et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts a chemistry of stars      2730.1320983967335
 symbol of the apostles in the mass for pope marcellus the voices blended singing alone loud in affirmation and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs      1576.1022855886802
 a horde of heresies fleeing with mitres awry photius and the brood of mockers of whom mulligan was one and arius warring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the son with the father and valentine spurning christs terrene body and the subtle african heresiarch sabellius who held that the father was himself his own son      1771.4197650804151
 words mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the stranger      2398.2583974384434
 idle mockery      40.07546579803417
 the void awaits surely all them that weave the wind a menace a disarming and a worsting from those embattled angels of the church michaels host who defend her ever in the hour of conflict with their lances and their shields      1458.1902371772949
 hear hear      346.26951731202263
 prolonged applause      319.9310234990272
 zut      16.32330158730159
 nom de dieu      722.3901799392395
 of course im a britisher hainess voice said and i feel as one      1211.5597841264466
 i dont want to see my country fall into the hands of german jews either      926.8269421601933
 thats our national problem im afraid just now      855.650469170031
 two men stood at the verge of the cliff watching businessman boatman      1520.6912810728325
 shes making for bullock harbour      1816.4731163886377
 the boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain      1628.3886096744097
 theres five fathoms out there he said      4207.708102327353
 itll be swept up that way when the tide comes in about one      1716.6477649573208
 its nine days today      528.8399041246606
 the man that was drowned      924.5908566203976
 a sail veering about the blank bay waiting for a swollen bundle to bob up roll over to the sun a puffy face saltwhite      1159.5382990979742
 they followed the winding path down to the creek      2606.3831856147326
 buck mulligan stood on a stone in shirtsleeves his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder      2250.0600541505455
 a young man clinging to a spur of rock near him moved slowly frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water      1633.46202020234
 is the brother with you malachi      511.8138068768242
 down in westmeath      509.6805320213983
 with the bannons      265.7506568124971
 still there      188.58505817482248
 i got a card from bannon      513.5937047719434
 says he found a sweet young thing down there      719.8273738607958
 photo girl he calls her      1973.0609417636308
 snapshot eh      188.58505817482248
 brief exposure      351.32481416701336
 buck mulligan sat down to unlace his boots      2536.5007923101643
 an elderly man shot up near the spur of rock a blowing red face      1611.8789676895667
 he scrambled up by the stones water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair water rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black sagging loincloth      2168.8533018281173
 buck mulligan made way for him to scramble past and glancing at haines and stephen crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips and breastbone      1959.951258091521
 seymours back in town the young man said grasping again his spur of rock      2714.130202351847
 chucked medicine and going in for the army      5521.731485750755

 seymour a bleeding officer      1907.4307522729946
 he nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up saying tritely redheaded women buck like goats      1984.6307465937357
 he broke off in alarm feeling his side under his flapping shirt      1737.1676728007976
 my twelfth rib is gone he cried      1946.8938715862357
 im the übermensch      194.3688728784529
 toothless kinch and i the supermen      2248.0455525886123
 he struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his clothes lay      3744.9640959838857
 are you going in here malachi      667.6969810464514
 make room in the bed      1009.7637870023716
 the young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the middle of the creek in two long clean strokes      2635.603168684651
 haines sat down on a stone smoking      990.6839014711009
 are you not coming in      333.6674418865883
 buck mulligan asked      1325.1627305873783
 later on haines said      643.1591360611468
 not on my breakfast      1525.0269942617258
 stephen turned away      865.8220654284644
 im going mulligan he said      369.07348056699897
 stephen handed him the key      2363.684247422802
 and twopence he said for a pint      946.236106479472
 throw it there      1316.8241189325138
 stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap      5131.941728789947
 dressing undressing      319.9310234990272
 buck mulligan erect with joined hands before him said solemnly he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the lord      3536.954083929574
 thus spake zarathustra      1316.8241189325138
 his plump body plunged      495.6192290196319
 well see you again haines said turning as stephen walked up the path and smiling at wild irish      1197.0649775021095
 horn of a bull hoof of a horse smile of a saxon      680.224150962792
 the ship buck mulligan cried      924.5908566203976
 half twelve      346.26951731202263
 good stephen said      878.7445988018139
 he walked along the upwardcurving path      506.00046767088185
 liliata rutilantium      387.14108962286144
 turma circumdet      394.2451884054323

 the priests grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly      2279.537452521024
 i will not sleep here tonight      269.28442966873513
 home also i cannot go      1648.930484200203
 a voice sweettoned and sustained called to him from the sea      653.3206700749713
 turning the curve he waved his hand      4028.239552335124
 it called again      261.83042261321026
 a sleek brown head a seals far out on the water round      1242.3716942236647

 where      16.32330158730159
 the boys blank face asked the blank window      1988.518815210668
 fabled by the daughters of memory      1684.7706207217711
 and yet it was in some way if not as memory fabled it      866.2188045835857
 a phrase then of impatience thud of blakes wings of excess      762.7339687338816
 i hear the ruin of all space shattered glass and toppling masonry and time one livid final flame      889.4016531572694

 asculum stephen said glancing at the name and date in the gorescarred book      2557.047247524274
 and he said another victory like that and we are done for      590.6789779441827
 that phrase the world had remembered      663.2227662759491
 a dull ease of the mind      558.2409659562031
 from a hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers leaned upon his spear      959.0057899996275
 any general to any officers      455.2353341433966
 they lend ear      1316.8241189325138
 you armstrong stephen said      1720.5063694982675
 what was the end of pyrrhus      611.3800648384513

 you armstrong      591.3677826081484
 do you know anything about pyrrhus      695.1232053841211
 a bag of figrolls lay snugly in armstrongs satchel      386.8122389994564
 he curled them between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly      2498.755469318341
 crumbs adhered to the tissue of his lips      2296.308654129463
 a sweetened boys breath      76.80699105159034

 pyrrhus sir      319.9310234990272
 pyrrhus a pier      1554.8950387435907
 all laughed      25.70556934472698
 mirthless high malicious laughter      676.7551206419264
 armstrong looked round at his classmates silly glee in profile      3974.4921967051473
 in a moment they will laugh more loudly aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay      1252.206531045386
 tell me now stephen said poking the boys shoulder with the book what is a pier      1967.8110349577419
 a pier sir armstrong said      111.05719580798517
 a thing out in the water      275.7561151930138
 a kind of a bridge      132.2168583370066
 kingstown pier sir      345.63303124547195
 some laughed again mirthless but with meaning      981.7260581416534
 two in the back bench whispered      438.4830915464399
 they knew had never learned nor ever been innocent      3646.1093697900797
 all      16.32330158730159
 with envy he watched their faces edith ethel gerty lily      2740.71076294832
 their likes their breaths too sweetened with tea and jam their bracelets tittering in the struggle      2068.723327284263
 kingstown pier stephen said      1084.7197169847775
 yes a disappointed bridge      1927.8339833327163
 the words troubled their gaze      924.5908566203976
 how sir      346.26951731202263
 comyn asked      305.38100980332894
 a bridge is across a river      292.19567931544395
 for hainess chapbook      609.287474853963
 noone here to hear      823.2119993192437
 tonight deftly amid wild drink and talk to pierce the polished mail of his mind      4321.667859024677
 what then      356.60819054830694
 a jester at the court of his master indulged and disesteemed winning a clement masters praise      1138.2567120046726
 why had they chosen all that part      1022.1379803658306
 not wholly for the smooth caress      1054.5984401365245
 for them too history was a tale like any other too often heard their land a pawnshop      1354.9223916783167
 had pyrrhus not fallen by a beldams hand in argos or julius caesar not been knifed to death      2409.7833873593177
 they are not to be thought away      1022.9334742406951
 time has branded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite possibilities they have ousted      1334.0425843862006
 but can those have been possible seeing that they never were      1455.1644643034795
 or was that only possible which came to pass      544.6316112303274
 weave weaver of the wind      1347.4220776734694
 tell us a story sir      3430.489562519993
 o do sir      68.72515991456633
 a ghoststory      25.70556934472698
 where do you begin in this      3965.1297717004463
 stephen asked opening another book      2363.684247422802
 weep no more comyn said      2503.147146116554
 go on then talbot      359.43176781886706
 and the story sir      647.0454708148945
 after stephen said      210.42843011416375
 he recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text weep no more woful shepherds weep no more for lycidas your sorrow is not dead sunk though he be beneath the watery floor      2147.000881038756
 it must be a movement then an actuality of the possible as possible      702.3503730748032
 aristotles phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated out into the studious silence of the library of saint genevieve where he had read sheltered from the sin of paris night by night      2210.877368052123
 by his elbow a delicate siamese conned a handbook of strategy      1330.0201452950091
 fed and feeding brains about me under glowlamps impaled with faintly beating feelers and in my minds darkness a sloth of the underworld reluctant shy of brightness shifting her dragon scaly folds      1633.2326448195668
 thought is the thought of thought      3852.3718199946147
 tranquil brightness      394.2451884054323
 the soul is in a manner all that is the soul is the form of forms      744.8873634038649
 tranquility sudden vast candescent form of forms      3730.3075484505753
 talbot repeated through the dear might of him that walked the waves through the dear might      2536.771933647692
 turn over stephen said quietly      5539.705673134327
 i dont see anything      117.85881170333587
 what sir      356.60819054830694
 talbot asked simply bending forward      1209.43541843472
 his hand turned the page over      490.14880787534463
 he leaned back and went on again having just remembered      1887.7906093676486
 of him that walked the waves      447.6006494690832
 here also over these craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffers heart and lips and on mine      1934.194139447036
 it lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the tribute      889.0923095448283
 to caesar what is caesars to god what is gods      874.9860816215803
 a long look from dark eyes a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the churchs looms      1161.7707287983199
 ay      16.32330158730159
 riddle me riddle me randy ro      2028.5307085315922
 my father gave me seeds to sow      980.3378804372347
 talbot slid his closed book into his satchel      1075.9847459533398
 have i heard all      885.9191068992847
 stephen asked      188.58505817482248
 hockey at ten sir      1136.6230497284312
 half day sir      213.32167721622653
 thursday      16.32330158730159
 who can answer a riddle      561.322866895034
 stephen asked      188.58505817482248
 they bundled their books away pencils clacking pages rustling      3953.222137070603
 crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels all gabbling gaily a riddle sir      3220.3540063923756
 ask me sir      128.70586393244
 o ask me sir      60.20720020283907
 a hard one sir      104.07687471895579
 this is the riddle stephen said the cock crew the sky was blue the bells in heaven were striking eleven      1144.2181677419858
 tis time for this poor soul to go to heaven      601.5397151957529
 what is that      1119.003560432706
 what sir      356.60819054830694
 we didnt hear      1007.1799477566752
 their eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated      1963.0365700282418
 after a silence cochrane said what is it sir      478.7415022063471
 we give it up      409.87566690349865
 stephen his throat itching answered the fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush      1688.7054956846137
 he stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries echoed dismay      1338.6286796146262
 a stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called hockey      1236.22190728919
 they broke asunder sidling out of their benches leaping them      3352.873939921103
 quickly they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and clamour of their boots and tongues      3677.247094340251
 sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly showing an open copybook      2524.6526163219196
 his tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading      1102.2504803629142
 on his cheek dull and bloodless a soft stain of ink lay dateshaped recent and damp as a snails bed      1323.8741871060981
 he held out his copybook      764.1924438359162
 the word sums was written on the headline      1850.3127753935178
 beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with blind loops and a blot      2446.7093756882937
 cyril sargent his name and seal      2478.822005790083
 mr deasy told me to write them out all again he said and show them to you sir      1271.9491512247628
 stephen touched the edges of the book      3725.054416671768
 futility      16.32330158730159
 he asked      346.26951731202263
 numbers eleven to fifteen sargent answered      4207.436848092414
 mr deasy said i was to copy them off the board sir      858.2007255844558
 can you do them yourself      346.52376850702404
 stephen asked      188.58505817482248
 no sir      682.8526969577732
 ugly and futile lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink a snails bed      2613.641457009437
 yet someone had loved him borne him in her arms and in her heart      2071.4195388825965
 but for her the race of the world would have trampled him underfoot a squashed boneless snail      1854.2232189605684
 she had loved his weak watery blood drained from her own      959.4934058519325
 was that then real      397.29694089379376
 the only true thing in life      904.1383743901066
 his mothers prostrate body the fiery columbanus in holy zeal bestrode      1801.5845349389122
 she was no more the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the fire an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes      1094.6001647705768
 she had saved him from being trampled underfoot and had gone scarcely having been      1262.2306759064656
 a poor soul gone to heaven and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox red reek of rapine in his fur with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth listened scraped up the earth listened scraped and scraped      1068.5054855930243
 sitting at his side stephen solved out the problem      1258.2486921458117
 he proves by algebra that shakespeares ghost is hamlets grandfather      2541.223678047842
 sargent peered askance through his slanted glasses      2857.1007736335378
 hockeysticks rattled in the lumberroom the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field      2665.9243974974816
 across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice in the mummery of their letters wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes      1437.0681517256562
 give hands traverse bow to partner so imps of fancy of the moors      1471.010477066026
 gone too from the world averroes and moses maimonides dark men in mien and movement flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the world a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not comprehend      2096.526067514156
 do you understand now      238.88726126360288
 can you work the second for yourself      778.3600853520288
 in long shaky strokes sargent copied the data      1414.723882717957
 amor matris subjective and objective genitive      403.73035094568763
 with her weak blood and wheysour milk she had fed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands      1757.3012447868962
 like him was i these sloping shoulders this gracelessness      984.676441686445
 my childhood bends beside me      873.3750854209711
 too far for me to lay a hand there once or lightly      1065.9495420724488
 mine is far and his secret as our eyes      428.65592982144506
 secrets silent stony sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts secrets weary of their tyranny tyrants willing to be dethroned      2788.348850675381
 the sum was done      2223.899512427845
 it is very simple stephen said as he stood up      693.1172398399875
 thanks sargent answered      1316.8241189325138
 he dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his copybook back to his bench      1729.709317617422
 you had better get your stick and go out to the others stephen said as he followed towards the door the boys graceless form      2751.0321604130268
 in the corridor his name was heard called from the playfield      1192.464366175222

 run on stephen said      4068.3627129294496
 he stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy field where sharp voices were in strife      1373.612252606491
 they were sorted in teams and mr deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet      2686.8230372270723
 when he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to him      1511.4791556093824
 he turned his angry white moustache      1381.389299750709
 what is it now      580.3536400083609
 he cried continually without listening      726.7312662180573
 cochrane and halliday are on the same side sir stephen said      1316.1388279867397
 will you wait in my study for a moment mr deasy said till i restore order here      902.9515737232821
 and as he stepped fussily back across the field his old mans voice cried sternly what is the matter      1088.7141819223136
 what is it now      580.3536400083609
 their sharp voices cried about him on all sides their many forms closed round him the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed head      1870.2677270256227
 stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded leather of its chairs      958.4974700899634
 as on the first day he bargained with me here      750.6176214630843
 as it was in the beginning is now      256.3609173461069
 on the sideboard the tray of stuart coins base treasure of a bog and ever shall be      1669.89342901432
 and snug in their spooncase of purple plush faded the twelve apostles having preached to all the gentiles world without end      1429.5089523120378
 a hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor      729.4511900838795
 blowing out his rare moustache mr deasy halted at the table      2000.3629057329579
 first our little financial settlement he said      1026.1563716979745
 he brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong      2350.4625816024386
 it slapped open and he took from it two notes one of joined halves and laid them carefully on the table      1135.224477763361
 two he said strapping and stowing his pocketbook away      887.6463357659338
 and now his strongroom for the gold      725.431457377839
 stephens embarrassed hand moved over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar whelks and money cowries and leopard shells and this whorled as an emirs turban and this the scallop of saint james      2361.7989673957813
 an old pilgrims hoard dead treasure hollow shells      449.67202922952947
 a sovereign fell bright and new on the soft pile of the tablecloth      1271.1633397792314
 three mr deasy said turning his little savingsbox about in his hand      2528.5465160474537

 no thanks at all mr deasy said      724.7327211865048
 you have earned it      1720.5063694982675
 stephens hand free again went back to the hollow shells      2828.6648135864907
 symbols too of beauty and of power      3212.1661047127855
 a lump in my pocket symbols soiled by greed and misery      495.70825285436445

 iago stephen murmured      42.41576691605684
 he lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old mans stare      1356.5804815227605
 he knew what money was mr deasy said      2559.1965039570437

 a french celt said that      329.94531237465435

 i knew you couldnt he said joyously      1069.047641884086

 i fear those big words stephen said which make us so unhappy      824.8730087613235
 mr deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the shapely bulk of a man in tartan fillibegs albert edward prince of wales      2324.6615392440494
 you think me an old fogey and an old tory his thoughtful voice said      1413.9897986351364
 i saw three generations since oconnells time      146.80331318049838
 i remember the famine in       342.42651113672855
 do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the union twenty years before oconnell did or before the prelates of your communion denounced him as a demagogue      1703.7325933379816

 i have rebel blood in me too mr deasy said      694.9826828289189
 on the spindle side      310.3118301099595

 alas stephen said      207.8929009455482
 per vias rectas mr deasy said firmly was his motto      704.2085677370566
 he voted for it and put on his topboots to ride to dublin from the ards of down to do so      1080.9962617030485

 sit down a moment      523.2429269727155
 i have just to copy the end      483.97478043907535
 he went to the desk near the window pulled in his chair twice and read off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter      1779.6997039396376
 sit down      188.58505817482248
 excuse me he said over his shoulder the dictates of common sense      2072.965768123637
 just a moment      993.567739272418
 he peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow and muttering began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly sometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error      2714.51735805624
 stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence      5131.941728789947
 framed around the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage their meek heads poised in air lord hastings repulse the duke of westminsters shotover the duke of beauforts ceylon prix de paris       1539.9470463637992
 elfin riders sat them watchful of a sign      1564.0882924693615
 he saw their speeds backing kings colours and shouted with the shouts of vanished crowds      955.3621905376706
 full stop mr deasy bade his keys      1831.0608699840125
 but prompt ventilation of this allimportant question      2163.8602077567934
 where cranly led me to get rich quick hunting his winners among the mudsplashed brakes amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek of the canteen over the motley slush      2292.3155410472846

 shouts rang shrill from the boys playfield and a whirring whistle      1954.875432138996
 again a goal      303.49031291261514
 i am among them among their battling bodies in a medley the joust of life      700.4673205578732

 jousts slush and uproar of battles the frozen deathspew of the slain a shout of spearspikes baited with mens bloodied guts      2290.666307798042
 now then mr deasy said rising      1005.2266685572052
 he came to the table pinning together his sheets      669.0120634191736
 stephen stood up      865.8220654284644
 i have put the matter into a nutshell mr deasy said      911.6935516969708
 its about the foot and mouth disease      378.32329118907415

 he raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke      808.3022656871508
 mark my words mr dedalus he said      862.8225242757865
 england is in the hands of the jews      3793.1400230641398
 in all the highest places her finance her press      519.6268002628785
 and they are the signs of a nations decay      1845.8211080109093
 wherever they gather they eat up the nations vital strength      4051.297897579996
 i have seen it coming these years      483.97478043907535
 as sure as we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of destruction      594.9203996374445
 old england is dying      1230.1303296218118
 he stepped swiftly off his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a broad sunbeam      2166.404967582529
 he faced about and back again      539.3526561753284
 dying he said again if not dead by now      2258.49256032916
 the harlots cry from street to street shall weave old englands windingsheet      2237.8957104710544
 his eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which he halted      1239.5953065323536
 a merchant stephen said is one who buys cheap and sells dear jew or gentile is he not      2217.6081534988953
 they sinned against the light mr deasy said gravely      1945.2665149541724
 and you can see the darkness in their eyes      755.5409997475253
 and that is why they are wanderers on the earth to this day      516.865164023414
 gabble of geese      323.8851262484066
 they swarmed loud uncouth about the temple their heads thickplotting under maladroit silk hats      2077.9409336086487
 not theirs these clothes this speech these gestures      2008.2838454841524
 their full slow eyes belied the words the gestures eager and unoffending but knew the rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was vain      2589.2155864951806
 vain patience to heap and hoard      362.20231549948153
 time surely would scatter all      1084.1826494315935
 a hoard heaped by the roadside plundered and passing on      509.4584778159675
 their eyes knew their years of wandering and patient knew the dishonours of their flesh      2639.593297504851

 stephen said      188.58505817482248
 what do you mean      580.3536400083609
 mr deasy asked      1220.111615837502
 he came forward a pace and stood by the table      872.4951748740345
 his underjaw fell sideways open uncertainly      518.4210451900069
 history stephen said is a nightmare from which i am trying to awake      2595.262097380155
 from the playfield the boys raised a shout      1904.6604825379045
 a whirring whistle goal      105.61917445610851
 what if that nightmare gave you a back kick      491.9388969730845
 the ways of the creator are not our ways mr deasy said      1335.1033994668396
 all human history moves towards one great goal the manifestation of god      1083.0072175809823

 mr deasy asked      1220.111615837502
 a shout in the street stephen answered shrugging his shoulders      487.0372606690102
 mr deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked between his fingers      1562.124914000329
 looking up again he set them free      1854.5825574366206

 we have committed many errors and many sins      1243.1628328115212
 a woman brought sin into the world      255.82616084962277
 for a woman who was no better than she should be helen the runaway wife of menelaus ten years the greeks made war on troy      726.3362822308047
 a faithless wife first brought the strangers to our shore here macmurroughs wife and her leman orourke prince of breffni      907.9648078591337
 a woman too brought parnell low      309.9010431479395

 and here what will you learn more      864.2753916617556
 mr deasy shook his head      820.4805274191455
 who knows      356.60819054830694
 he said      346.26951731202263
 to learn one must be humble      920.4177542665633
 but life is the great teacher      1538.9404947719174
 stephen rustled the sheets again      2363.684247422802

 i like to break a lance with you old as i am      546.5709457137417
 good morning sir stephen said again bowing to his bent back      1684.9999933580866
 he went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield      1928.4379037738431
 the lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate toothless terrors      1771.8986047939306
 still i will help him in his fight      730.6177334781829

 yes sir stephen said turning back at the gate      771.8049114937986
 mr deasy halted breathing hard and swallowing his breath      1453.3117013838248
 i just wanted to say he said      760.4353059322053
 ireland they say has the honour of being the only country which never persecuted the jews      1512.9525276039838
 do you know that      238.88726126360288
 and do you know why      340.51279755904613
 he frowned sternly on the bright air      1458.5733778322494
 why sir      356.60819054830694
 stephen asked beginning to smile      2363.684247422802
 because she never let them in mr deasy said solemnly      1539.0373958443683
 a coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a rattling chain of phlegm      1108.025349077383
 he turned back quickly coughing laughing his lifted arms waving to the air      2022.0431706514444
 she never let them in he cried again through his laughter as he stamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path      1974.4741098264988
 thats why      394.2451884054323

 the dog yelped running to them reared up and pawed them dropping on all fours again reared up at them with mute bearish fawning      3168.3571320732567
 unheeded he kept by them as they came towards the drier sand a rag of wolfs tongue redpanting from his jaws      2818.898424279709

 he turned his face over a shoulder rere regardant      3400.135440955241
 moving through the air high spars of a threemaster her sails brailed up on the crosstrees homing upstream silently moving a silent ship      2358.348495450319
 ii mr leopold bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls      1159.031353443651
 he liked thick giblet soup nutty gizzards a stuffed roast heart liverslices fried with crustcrumbs fried hencods roes      1531.8414834328144
 most of all he liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of faintly scented urine      1142.4948500546834
 kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly righting her breakfast things on the humpy tray      1681.794653874067
 gelid light and air were in the kitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere      1817.1166884441316
 made him feel a bit peckish      531.853557836832
 the coals were reddening      2223.899512427845
 another slice of bread and butter three four right      1507.7452762214398
 she didnt like her plate full      987.8139874655808
 he turned from the tray lifted the kettle off the hob and set it sideways on the fire      2873.6870739122273
 it sat there dull and squat its spout stuck out      603.221763543545
 cup of tea soon      2191.1821172514265
 good      16.32330158730159
 mouth dry      252.1600697633723
 the cat walked stiffly round a leg of the table with tail on high      1481.0208925682866
 o there you are mr bloom said turning from the fire      1545.9204960345403
 the cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the table mewing      1192.0290638960576
 just how she stalks over my writingtable      1519.5269771860173

 mr bloom watched curiously kindly the lithe black form      1774.591445055165
 clean to see the gloss of her sleek hide the white button under the butt of her tail the green flashing eyes      1734.6058459637443
 he bent down to her his hands on his knees      1735.7550882109351
 milk for the pussens he said      695.495845065014
 mrkgnao      16.32330158730159
 the cat cried      1316.8241189325138
 they call them stupid      2223.899512427845
 they understand what we say better than we understand them      3945.4649546403575
 she understands all she wants to      1072.710371195325
 vindictive too      836.3203385149477
 cruel      16.32330158730159
 her nature      346.26951731202263
 curious mice never squeal      2691.883824364254
 seem to like it      1348.7572195759922
 wonder what i look like to her      3649.482031791857
 height of a tower      680.0386263712007
 no she can jump me      458.2262632940057
 afraid of the chickens she is he said mockingly      423.6032877126826
 afraid of the chookchooks      699.6010491308197
 i never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens      1121.357472198953
 mrkrgnao      16.32330158730159
 the cat said loudly      2223.899512427845
 she blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes mewing plaintively and long showing him her milkwhite teeth      2055.5917781398875
 he watched the dark eyeslits narrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones      1994.9348724371678
 then he went to the dresser took the jug hanlons milkman had just filled for him poured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor      2409.044341169905
 gurrhr      16.32330158730159
 she cried running to lap      682.5732504168823
 he watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped three times and licked lightly      2145.3135326887827
 wonder is it true if you clip them they cant mouse after      880.7943816291283
 why      16.32330158730159
 they shine in the dark perhaps the tips      2336.4547178197145
 or kind of feelers in the dark perhaps      1220.731134202062
 he listened to her licking lap      632.631010181851
 ham and eggs no      486.458612842656
 no good eggs with this drouth      853.091383186693
 want pure fresh water      756.0057446049952
 thursday not a good day either for a mutton kidney at buckleys      3126.0427729122894
 fried with butter a shake of pepper      1046.0056545695065
 better a pork kidney at dlugaczs      3981.595242961506
 while the kettle is boiling      1243.3588496458437
 she lapped slower then licking the saucer clean      1002.8223389740808
 why are their tongues so rough      655.5201228246244
 to lap better all porous holes      407.7414297506931
 nothing she can eat      1525.0269942617258
 he glanced round him      434.0085591113503
 on quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall paused by the bedroom door      2524.2156094915863
 she might like something tasty      682.5732504168823
 thin bread and butter she likes in the morning      2004.1332536342861
 still perhaps once in a way      1713.125133151691
 he said softly in the bare hall im going round the corner      669.6913389259053
 be back in a minute      759.7674401395992
 and when he had heard his voice say it he added you dont want anything for breakfast      1044.1038878871848
 a sleepy soft grunt answered mn      432.6727808884628
 she didnt want anything      1521.8251161867581
 he heard then a warm heavy sigh softer as she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled      1255.815277763819
 must get those settled really      2531.6742496259308
 pity      16.32330158730159
 all the way from gibraltar      351.77380886720147

 old style      114.87743334017172
 ah yes      25.70556934472698
 of course      114.87743334017172
 bought it at the governors auction      3590.194660028345

 hard as nails at a bargain old tweedy      553.3030805507824

 i rose from the ranks sir and im proud of it      885.3219315100117
 still he had brains enough to make that corner in stamps      1264.1482832397655
 now that was farseeing      1450.4073343053915
 his hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoat and his lost property office secondhand waterproof      911.5028356656758
 stamps stickyback pictures      865.8220654284644
 daresay lots of officers are in the swim too      1066.1936266073205
 course they do      524.7639939839336
 the sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely plastos high grade ha      2505.287617899321
 he peeped quickly inside the leather headband      1517.32738301476
 white slip of paper      724.6334678703145
 quite safe      1024.2790454366598
 on the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey      1528.9931788707222
 not there      682.8526969577732
 in the trousers i left off      705.1705209739287

 creaky wardrobe      305.38100980332894
 no use disturbing her      310.31183010995954
 she turned over sleepily that time      1059.0387559527137
 he pulled the halldoor to after him very quietly more till the footleaf dropped gently over the threshold a limp lid      2565.557878281599
 looked shut      387.14108962286144
 all right till i come back anyhow      549.5612488152307
 he crossed to the bright side avoiding the loose cellarflap of number seventyfive      1866.3081469571437
 the sun was nearing the steeple of georges church      1442.6075197344455
 be a warm day i fancy      178.88078762865212

 but i couldnt go in that light suit      594.3968518347866
 make a picnic of it      1009.7637870023716
 his eyelids sank quietly often as he walked in happy warmth      1502.9313426039953
 bolands breadvan delivering with trays our daily but she prefers yesterdays loaves turnovers crisp crowns hot      2002.020738414117

 sunburst on the titlepage      2515.6281063210195
 he smiled pleasing himself      434.0085591113503
 what arthur griffith said about the headpiece over the freeman leader a homerule sun rising up in the northwest from the laneway behind the bank of ireland      1464.6798914184772
 he prolonged his pleased smile      740.3883502995898
 ikey touch that homerule sun rising up in the northwest      1960.2148349756242
 he approached larry orourkes      434.0085591113503
 from the cellar grating floated up the flabby gush of porter      1675.8481380876592
 through the open doorway the bar squirted out whiffs of ginger teadust biscuitmush      3175.3642846881658
 good house however just the end of the city traffic      1784.3574872181473
 for instance mauleys down there n      500.0613602397948
 as position      25.70556934472698
 of course if they ran a tramline along the north circular from the cattlemarket to the quays value would go up like a shot      1176.9449961255752

 there he is sure enough my bold larry leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching the aproned curate swab up with mop and bucket      2077.622601428701

 sad thing about poor dignam mr orourke      787.1440695010459
 turning into dorset street he said freshly in greeting through the doorway good day mr orourke      2103.0178544852724
 lovely weather sir      623.4620045291721
 tis all that      312.7307962966023
 where do they get the money      3965.1297717004463
 then lo and behold they blossom out as adam findlaters or dan tallons      1053.8180098537339
 then think of the competition      4116.775687692802
 general thirst      682.8526969577732
 good puzzle would be cross dublin without passing a pub      688.7845958966967
 save it they cant      646.8740453207647
 off the drunks perhaps      1342.194156576496
 put down three and carry five      1384.2259773990754
 what is that a bob here and there dribs and drabs      771.3443971072883

 he scalded and rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea tilting the kettle then to let the water flow in      1546.9867849621255
 having set it to draw he took off the kettle crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watched the lump of butter slide and melt      1114.1366489848492

 he looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large soft bubs sloping within her nightdress like a shegoats udder      2137.556298718262
 the warmth of her couched body rose on the air mingling with the fragrance of the tea she poured      1625.3116045636255
 a strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow      648.4891620025479

 he came nearer and heard a crunching of gilded oats the gently champing teeth      1345.5398865616144
 their full buck eyes regarded him as he went by amid the sweet oaten reek of horsepiss      2496.0735030008254

 there is a word throstle that expresses that      1427.1963587563096
 his eyes passed lightly over mr powers goodlooking face      1345.772333276361
 greyish over the ears      3366.3168076438233
 madame smiling      252.1600697633723
 i smiled back      31.33630907356715

 martin cunningham nudged mr power      1157.0357670627325
 of the tribe of reuben he said      1353.8515006454777
 a tall blackbearded figure bent on a stick stumping round the corner of elverys elephant house showed them a curved hand open on his spine      1763.6555440648854
 in all his pristine beauty mr power said      361.25376754565315
 mr dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly the devil break the hasp of your back      2487.5511530748045
 mr power collapsing in laughter shaded his face from the window as the carriage passed grays statue      2159.8737789613842
 his eyes met mr blooms eyes      465.01370408584455
 he caressed his beard adding well nearly all of us      1492.5636709961827
 mr bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions faces      1655.2686438278718
 thats an awfully good one thats going the rounds about reuben j and the son      1230.7781962736597
 about the boatman      194.8644865701363
 what is that      1119.003560432706
 mr dedalus asked      1220.111615837502
 i didnt hear it      117.85881170333587
 there was a girl in the case mr bloom began and he determined to send him to the isle of man out of harms way but when they were both      967.9055711042599
 mr dedalus asked      1220.111615837502
 that confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it      663.2227662759491
 yes mr bloom said      1927.8339833327163

 mr dedalus cried      1220.111615837502
 i wish to christ he did      211.88030043823164
 mr power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils      1440.0588680647138
 no mr bloom said the son himself      616.072347599516
 martin cunningham thwarted his speech rudely reuben j and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on their way to the isle of man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got loose and over the wall with him into the liffey      3045.438858415264
 for gods sake      609.287474853963
 mr dedalus exclaimed in fright      820.4805274191455
 is he dead      160.14523668663173
 dead      16.32330158730159
 martin cunningham cried      172.66713880248363
 not he      682.8526969577732
 a boatman got a pole and fished him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father on the quay more dead than alive      805.9922679587436
 half the town was there      1202.4439936779156
 yes mr bloom said      1927.8339833327163
 but the funny part is      1076.6637392816992
 and reuben j martin cunningham said gave the boatman a florin for saving his sons life      1264.9393428326223
 a stifled sigh came from under mr powers hand      856.213154854546
 o he did martin cunningham affirmed      298.3701745217996
 like a hero      308.9625884764698
 a silver florin      25.184431427451194
 mr bloom said eagerly      493.46820026536955
 one and eightpence too much mr dedalus said drily      659.4065268373602
 mr powers choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage      2193.3460765661935
 nelsons pillar      682.8526969577732
 eight plums a penny      835.8475180225527
 eight for a penny      835.8475180225527
 we had better look a little serious martin cunningham said      950.9114124618125
 mr dedalus sighed      1220.111615837502
 ah then indeed he said poor little paddy wouldnt grudge us a laugh      1349.4118058047122
 many a good one he told himself      483.3768435868556
 the lord forgive me      2223.899512427845
 mr power said wiping his wet eyes with his fingers      1440.0588680647138
 poor paddy      319.9310234990272
 i little thought a week ago when i saw him last and he was in his usual health that id be driving after him like this      1330.8944538008952
 hes gone from us      1475.1899059864454

 a lot of money he spent colouring it      312.0068012437253
 mr power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension      1440.0588680647138
 he had a sudden death poor fellow he said      420.8701661841894
 the best death mr bloom said      1312.3799986964746
 no suffering he said      310.31183010995954
 a moment and all is over      289.6506416642564

 the greatest disgrace to have in the family mr power added      2697.41293839427
 temporary insanity of course martin cunningham said decisively      2066.376574933109

 they halted about the door of the mortuary chapel      1833.4617900182084
 mr bloom stood behind the boy with the wreath looking down at his sleekcombed hair and at the slender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar      1992.978702166201

 after a moment he followed the others in blinking in the screened light      951.3859512430132
 the coffin lay on its bier before the chancel four tall yellow candles at its corners      1400.7145709726801
 always in front of us      385.3827409278799
 mr bloom stood behind near the font and when all had knelt dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper from his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it      1926.3023608111755
 he fitted his black hat gently on his left knee and holding its brim bent over piously      1450.4422923170387
 a server bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out through a door      1322.5118764535682

 the priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boys bucket and shook it over the coffin      1457.6112468297808
 then he walked to the other end and shook it again      1312.1151719461693
 then he came back and put it back in the bucket      1304.3807765202848

 mr bloom came last folding his paper again into his pocket      1372.4895471802263
 he gazed gravely at the ground till the coffincart wheeled off to the left      1178.7573701813085
 the metal wheels ground the gravel with a sharp grating cry and the pack of blunt boots followed the trundled barrow along a lane of sepulchres      2812.0309171405347

 mr power took his arm      820.4805274191455

 corny kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to plod by      5047.409938889157
 sad occasions mr kernan began politely      320.4136092552975
 mr bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head      1372.4895471802263

 the barrow turned into a side lane      870.632894468905
 the gravediggers touched their caps      924.5908566203976

 mr dedalus said i am come to pay you another visit      2181.9847348219346

 i dont want your custom at all      722.0261134879048
 saluting ned lambert and john henry menton he walked on at martin cunninghams side puzzling two long keys at his back      2684.168468457913
 did you hear that one he asked them about mulcahy from the coombe      1150.5194828946642
 i did not martin cunningham said      246.35803966315967
 they bent their silk hats in concert and hynes inclined his ear      2866.3753198211357
 the caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles      2352.5191345065864
 they tell the story he said that two drunks came out here one foggy evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs      2516.2067472304925
 they asked for mulcahy from the coombe and were told where he was buried      1802.8770451461085
 after traipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough      1334.4262118754493
 one of the drunks spelt out the name terence mulcahy      1148.9025340989897
 the other drunk was blinking up at a statue of our saviour the widow had got put up      3054.54277224823
 the caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed      1503.1812988580277
 he resumed and after blinking up at the sacred figure not a bloody bit like the man says he      1704.1385843860899
 thats not mulcahy says he whoever done it      1336.0400257263548
 rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with corny kelleher accepting the dockets given him turning them over and scanning them as he walked      2092.4904166718193
 thats all done with a purpose martin cunningham explained to hynes      822.969165641286

 the gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay in on the coffin      4194.020646876589
 mr bloom turned away his face      1400.5642919192455

 the mourners took heart of grace one by one covering themselves without show      3969.31600685803
 mr bloom put on his hat and saw the portly figure make its way deftly through the maze of graves      1398.7855308059568
 quietly sure of his ground he traversed the dismal fields      2558.901972497583

 o excuse me      68.72515991456633
 he stepped aside nimbly      434.0085591113503
 clay brown damp began to be seen in the hole      2002.0503481235094
 it rose      40.07546579803417
 nearly over      682.8526969577732
 a mound of damp clods rose more rose and the gravediggers rested their spades      641.9658912229364
 all uncovered again for a few instants      1178.9012932936475
 the boy propped his wreath against a corner the brotherinlaw his on a lump      2392.42375691583
 the gravediggers put on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards the barrow      3487.198752730863
 then knocked the blades lightly on the turf clean      2825.0173567560846
 one bent to pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass      1833.5534193772703
 one leaving his mates walked slowly on with shouldered weapon its blade blueglancing      1424.553782699765
 silently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband      2999.0824358811647
 his navelcord      346.26951731202263
 the brotherinlaw turning away placed something in his free hand      2923.44662182839

 the mourners moved away slowly without aim by devious paths staying at whiles to read a name on a tomb      2837.7429039013373
 let us go round by the chiefs grave hynes said      1476.4466833971799

 more sensible to spend the money on some charity for the living      1924.5353708039793

 the foreman turned round to hear patiently and lifting an elbow began to scratch slowly in the armpit of his alpaca jacket      2830.310752471873
 like that mr bloom said crossing his forefingers at the top      966.3882034973641

 no thanks professor machugh said waving the cigarettecase aside      1567.426113769769
 wait a moment      197.65453300813604
 let me say one thing      966.7887696465347
 the finest display of oratory i ever heard was a speech made by john f taylor at the college historical society      1631.4470124220763
 mr justice fitzgibbon the present lord justice of appeal had spoken and the paper under debate was an essay new for those days advocating the revival of the irish tongue      2066.852782452629
 he turned towards myles crawford and said you know gerald fitzgibbon      2422.133061808716
 then you can imagine the style of his discourse      2793.5522292231717
 he is sitting with tim healy j      310.6686329188807
 omolloy said rumour has it on the trinity college estates commission      1223.1411620999581
 he is sitting with a sweet thing myles crawford said in a childs frock      1115.2280757217648
 go on      682.8526969577732
 well      16.32330158730159
 it was the speech mark you the professor said of a finished orator full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction i will not say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud mans contumely upon the new movement      1984.7554217185466
 we were weak therefore worthless      738.6464818453067
 he closed his long thin lips an instant but eager to be on raised an outspanned hand to his spectacles and with trembling thumb and ringfinger touching lightly the black rims steadied them to a new focus      1404.450109283058
 impromptu in ferial tone he addressed j      1549.0306131598588
 omolloy taylor had come there you must know from a sickbed      1404.0605025568336
 that he had prepared his speech i do not believe for there was not even one shorthandwriter in the hall      1615.4104435414615
 his dark lean face had a growth of shaggy beard round it      1085.536420234704
 he wore a loose white silk neckcloth and altogether he looked though he was not a dying man      967.1482581352558
 his gaze turned at once but slowly from j      430.5818546393065
 omolloys towards stephens face and then bent at once to the ground seeking      2263.463977301266
 his unglazed linen collar appeared behind his bent head soiled by his withering hair      1030.419788973845
 still seeking he said when fitzgibbons speech had ended john f taylor rose to reply      1936.2340117506787
 he raised his head firmly      872.8946807927729
 his eyes bethought themselves once more      465.01370408584455
 witless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro seeking outlet      2079.3011237729193
 he began mr chairman ladies and gentlemen great was my admiration in listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of ireland a moment since by my learned friend      1210.4251201606605
 it seemed to me that i had been transported into a country far away from this country into an age remote from this age that i stood in ancient egypt and that i was listening to the speech of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful moses      1563.0174809117755
 his listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear their smokes ascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech      2436.4794006653365
 and let our crooked smokes      340.51279755904613
 noble words coming      722.3901799392395
 look out      387.14108962286144
 could you try your hand at it yourself      2030.1593369061197
 and it seemed to me that i heard the voice of that egyptian highpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride      1049.980846052343
 i heard his words and their meaning was revealed to me      558.8654116782211
 from the fathers it was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are corrupted which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they were good could be corrupted      1833.1247789498102
 ah curse you      192.99067352324482
 thats saint augustine      1316.8241189325138
 why will you jews not accept our culture our religion and our language      1992.7933010437453
 you have no cities nor no wealth our cities are hives of humanity and our galleys trireme and quadrireme laden with all manner merchandise furrow the waters of the known globe      1242.5003284351853

 vagrants and daylabourers are you called the world trembles at our name      1629.9685086241166
 a dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech      525.4473121096887
 he lifted his voice above it boldly but ladies and gentlemen had the youthful moses listened to and accepted that view of life had he bowed his head and bowed his will and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never have brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage nor followed the pillar of the cloud by day      1891.7052246116064
 he would never have spoken with the eternal amid lightnings on sinais mountaintop nor ever have come down with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the tables of the law graven in the language of the outlaw      2694.3893044779397
 he ceased and looked at them enjoying a silence      1188.2357047627697
 ominousfor him      114.87743334017172
 omolloy said not without regret and yet he died without having entered the land of promise      1117.674277433998

 and with a great future behind him      472.57298346261547
 the troop of bare feet was heard rushing along the hallway and pattering up the staircase      1252.3607871382465

 the blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way drawing his cane back feeling again      2373.419239917463
 mr bloom walked behind the eyeless feet a flatcut suit of herringbone tweed      1319.2144761088555
 poor young fellow      521.5377950116564
 how on earth did he know that van was there      640.475041218891
 must have felt it      1545.0478471001131
 see things in their forehead perhaps kind of sense of volume      2298.3252900685748
 weight or size of it something blacker than the dark      1955.062859437575
 wonder would he feel it if something was removed      2350.8541857801465

 or we are surprised they have any brains      399.5121946102487
 why we think a deformed person or a hunchback clever if he says something we might say      1130.5672567974107

 kind of a form in his minds eye      1128.4825872312108
 the voice temperatures when he touches her with his fingers must almost see the lines the curves      2707.1101761445875
 his hands on her hair for instance      378.9712874468895
 say it was black for instance      287.3057666620489
 good      16.32330158730159
 we call it black      409.87566690349865
 then passing over her white skin      1637.8181170591708

 again      16.32330158730159
 fibres of fine fine straw      1449.439166898803

 downy hair there too      1116.5666345562163

 and smiled yet again in going      463.9583103985309

 father conmee gave a letter from his breast to master brunny lynam and pointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of fitzgibbon street      1642.4441944812465
 but mind you dont post yourself into the box little man he said      1863.538384740574
 the boys sixeyed father conmee and laughed o sir      2169.6317163537683
 master brunny lynam ran across the road and put father conmees letter to father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox      2555.7606943955225
 father conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along mountjoy square east      2648.4033539103843
 mr denis j maginni professor of dancing c in silk hat slate frockcoat with silk facings white kerchief tie tight lavender trousers canary gloves and pointed patent boots walking with grave deportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady maxwell at the corner of dignams court      1319.3273103392748
 was that not mrs mguinness      238.98084687304635
 mrs mguinness stately silverhaired bowed to father conmee from the farther footpath along which she sailed      2382.912213200754
 and father conmee smiled and saluted      593.2421479956666
 how did she do      1228.2622447646763
 a fine carriage she had      121.91821110381264
 like mary queen of scots something      713.2687741535392
 and to think that she was a pawnbroker      451.7208717186214

 what should he say      580.3536400083609
 such a queenly mien      1682.3019070283776
 father conmee walked down great charles street and glanced at the shutup free church on his left      1857.6333525298278

 father conmee turned the corner and walked along the north circular road      2357.2719941211417
 it was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an important thoroughfare      609.7249460403891
 surely there ought to be      2926.082829989735
 a band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from richmond street      332.8952311467632
 all raised untidy caps      637.3380927125302
 christian brother boys      1095.0073997772863
 father conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked      2252.056325334577
 saint josephs church portland row      422.6131754027923
 father conmee raised his hat to the blessed sacrament      1691.4133644460871
 virtuous but occasionally they were also badtempered      2565.0861364876814
 near aldborough house father conmee thought of that spendthrift nobleman      1257.242494380256
 and now it was an office or something      1027.3712120993305
 father conmee began to walk along the north strand road and was saluted by mr william gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop      2018.18180280342
 father conmee saluted mr william gallagher and perceived the odours that came from baconflitches and ample cools of butter      2217.6723723087175
 he passed grogans the tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful catastrophe in new york      1971.8865534940549
 in america those things were continually happening      417.1700664533466
 unfortunate people to die like that unprepared      4748.870101014502
 still an act of perfect contrition      1713.125133151691
 father conmee went by daniel bergins publichouse against the window of which two unlabouring men lounged      2300.4425563391646
 they saluted him and were saluted      1752.3232127051951
 father conmee passed h      632.1609097221582
 oneills funeral establishment where corny kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay      2307.1345506019616
 a constable on his beat saluted father conmee and father conmee saluted the constable      991.2056072990947
 in youkstetters the porkbutchers father conmee observed pigs puddings white and black and red lie neatly curled in tubes      3440.0701281252154
 moored under the trees of charleville mall father conmee saw a turfbarge a towhorse with pendent head a bargeman with a hat of dirty straw seated amidships smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above him      3030.635123409958
 it was idyllic and father conmee reflected on the providence of the creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor people      2157.6553681409328
 on newcomen bridge the very reverend john conmee s      1993.2959184258307
 of saint francis xaviers church upper gardiner street stepped on to an outward bound tram      1136.782456367396
 off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend nicholas dudley c      783.712511042017
 of saint agathas church north william street on to newcomen bridge      411.84406996780905
 at newcomen bridge father conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past mud island      2283.8856826344468
 father conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar a blue ticket tucked with care in the eye of one plump kid glove while four shillings a sixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse      1562.8910526295313
 passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket      2214.0924916810045
 the solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to father conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap      2231.074065893211
 father conmee liked cheerful decorum      1185.965929242914
 it was a peaceful day      340.3255763489275
 his wife father conmee supposed      285.2262139119514
 a tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with the glasses      881.2346931978187
 she raised her small gloved fist yawned ever so gently tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily sweetly      1425.1691332412177
 father conmee perceived her perfume in the car      1452.6850642898203
 he perceived also that the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the seat      1923.1203991362117
 father conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head      1404.350573230388
 at annesley bridge the tram halted and when it was about to go an old woman rose suddenly from her place to alight      2350.171855066734
 the conductor pulled the bellstrap to stay the car for her      3150.5348840944266
 she passed out with her basket and a marketnet and father conmee saw the conductor help her and net and basket down and father conmee thought that as she had nearly passed the end of the penny fare she was one of those good souls who had always to be told twice bless you my child that they have been absolved pray for me      1785.8483352373794
 but they had so many worries in life so many cares poor creatures      2086.120978421477
 from the hoardings mr eugene stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at father conmee      1320.5313846462475
 father conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and of his sermon on saint peter claver s      3738.7638097210224
 and the african mission and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their last hour came like a thief in the night      1126.1263673441838
 that book by the belgian jesuit le nombre des élus seemed to father conmee a reasonable plea      1797.5181336068376
 those were millions of human souls created by god in his own likeness to whom the faith had not d      2140.8045100440436
 been brought      351.32481416701336
 but they were gods souls created by god      2612.201253218412
 it seemed to father conmee a pity that they should all be lost a waste if one might say      1461.6745801291563
 at the howth road stop father conmee alighted was saluted by the conductor and saluted in his turn      1376.4775973811932
 the malahide road was quiet      924.5908566203976
 it pleased father conmee road and name      933.8973757071149
 the joybells were ringing in gay malahide      1180.3382240734109
 then came the call to arms and she was maid wife and widow in one day      1663.9686903522072
 those were old worldish days loyal times in joyous townlands old times in the barony      2267.8455587824096
 father conmee walking thought of his little book old times in the barony and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of mary rochfort daughter of lord molesworth first countess of belvedere      2412.4016883937416
 a listless lady no more young walked alone the shore of lough ennel mary first countess of belvedere listlessly walking in the evening not startled when an otter plunged      1628.1709427706637
 who could know the truth      561.322866895034
 not the jealous lord belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed adultery fully eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris with her husbands brother      2398.1762807918176
 she would half confess if she had not all sinned as women did      1397.5590593968168
 father conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence needed however for mans race on earth and of the ways of god which were not our ways      3069.957966644303
 don john conmee walked and moved in times of yore      1163.2390540396518
 he bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at smiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom ceiled with full fruit clusters      1663.4378097525248
 and the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom noble to noble were impalmed by don john conmee      867.7128230636478
 it was a charming day      340.3255763489275
 the lychgate of a field showed father conmee breadths of cabbages curtseying to him with ample underleaves      2078.9768181682343
 the sky showed him a flock of small white clouds going slowly down the wind      2671.434176647824
 moutonner the french said      1123.480690196375
 a just and homely word      249.13582276320423
 father conmee reading his office watched a flock of muttoning clouds over rathcoffey      2648.4033539103843
 his thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of clongowes field      1174.784590077101
 he walked there reading in the evening and heard the cries of the boys lines at their play young cries in the quiet evening      2545.5570591399824
 he was their rector his reign was mild      450.42769060929265
 father conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out      2357.2719941211417
 an ivory bookmark told him the page      406.2253000551027
 nones      16.32330158730159
 he should have read that before lunch      1084.090324939426
 but lady maxwell had come      1076.6637392816992
 father conmee read in secret pater and ave and crossed his breast      2357.2719941211417
 deus in adiutorium      957.2528608178976
 he walked calmly and read mutely the nones walking and reading till he came to res in beati immaculati principium verborum tuorum veritas in eternum omnia iudicia iustitiæ tuæ      1659.625150121358
 a flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand      1763.6239565977069
 the young man raised his cap abruptly the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig      1443.6163504189628
 father conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his breviary      2648.4033539103843
 sin principes persecuti sunt me gratis et a verbis tuis formidavit cor meum      1538.5730721909074
 corny kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner      4201.174529185655
 he pulled himself erect went to it and spinning it on its axle viewed its shape and brass furnishings      2423.6911680406142
 chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came to the doorway      1863.3723263853335
 there he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes and leaned against the doorcase looking idly out      2019.0177244103352
 father john conmee stepped into the dollymount tram on newcomen bridge      1880.0090913014665
 corny kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed his hat downtilted chewing his blade of hay      4062.1489398618305
 constable c on his beat stood to pass the time of day      2075.2793046782485

 corny kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth while a generous white arm from a window in eccles street flung forth a coin      2392.79960254954
 whats the best news      580.3536400083609

 a onelegged sailor crutched himself round macconnells corner skirting rabaiottis icecream car and jerked himself up eccles street      1496.2485080181611
 he swung himself violently forward past katey and boody dedalus halted and growled home and beauty      2697.179014458391
 omolloys white careworn face was told that mr lambert was in the warehouse with a visitor      1804.6088468588932
 a stout lady stopped took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it into the cap held out to her      1727.9139581180502
 the sailor grumbled thanks glanced sourly at the unheeding windows sank his head and swung himself forward four strides      2578.361281522781
 he halted and growled angrily for england      836.6356775790823
 two barefoot urchins sucking long liquorice laces halted near him gaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths      2468.9093433553508
 he swung himself forward in vigorous jerks halted lifted his head towards a window and bayed deeply home and beauty      2450.2055547848727
 the gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two ceased      1973.8260147184155
 the blind of the window was drawn aside      1424.1757662545333
 a plump bare generous arm shone was seen held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut shiftstraps      1632.2995158391795

 john wyse nolan came down again      962.6755797082212
 from the cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass parliament street harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering      1836.4846996325907
 gaily they went past before his cool unfriendly eyes not quickly      2128.1299785775504

 there in the corner      2223.899512427845
 they chose a small table near the window opposite a longfaced man whose beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard      1164.272792323818
 haines asked twisting round in his seat      990.6839014711009
 yes mulligan said      1553.0933047558858
 thats john howard his brother our city marshal      1021.6177787947205
 john howard parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw went up again to his forehead whereat it rested      1949.4390221163765
 an instant after under its screen his eyes looked quickly ghostbright at his foe and fell once more upon a working corner      1727.1250408088092
 ill take a mélange haines said to the waitress      1055.8812511272859

 buck mulligan bent across the table gravely      1880.987563323341
 they drove his wits astray he said by visions of hell      3790.3495816620925
 he will never capture the attic note      889.2353718553235

 its rather interesting because professor pokorny of vienna makes an interesting point out of that      1400.05196904289
 buck mulligans watchful eyes saw the waitress come      2536.5007923101643
 he helped her to unload her tray      1713.5631939540924
 he can find no trace of hell in ancient irish myth haines said amid the cheerful cups      964.8169879512069
 the moral idea seems lacking the sense of destiny of retribution      1114.3992423879104
 rather strange he should have just that fixed idea      1608.3508252462034
 does he write anything for your movement      985.9136913326739
 he sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream      1278.9766785197216
 buck mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over its smoking pith      2250.0600541505455
 he bit off a soft piece hungrily      915.9482538419389
 he is going to write something in ten years      609.5153530505552

 still i shouldnt wonder if he did after all      487.517020215838
 he tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup      1152.8728915083884
