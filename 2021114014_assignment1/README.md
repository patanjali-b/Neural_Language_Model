## language_model.py: Runs the language model given the following:


$ python3 language_model.py <smoothing type> <path to corpus>

Smoothing type can be k for Kneser-Ney or w for Witten-Bell. On running the file, the expected output is
a prompt, which asks for a sentence and provides the probability of that sentence using the two smoothing
mechanisms. 
Therefore, an example would be:

$ python3 language_model.py k ./corpus.txt
input sentence: I am a woman.
