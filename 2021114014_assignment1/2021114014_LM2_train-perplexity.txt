a yellow dressinggown ungirdled was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air          16.20140694912781
 he held the bowl aloft and intoned introibo ad altare dei          10.448317630865079
 halted he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely come up kinch          13.523783967114973
 come up you fearful jesuit          54.68952481899477
 solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest          24.809398900185894
 he faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower the surrounding land and the awaking mountains          10.09005192254281
 then catching sight of stephen dedalus he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air gurgling in his throat and shaking his head          9.456442793527227
 stephen dedalus displeased and sleepy leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed him equine in its length and at the light untonsured hair grained and hued like pale oak          5.404546876192228
 buck mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowl smartly          19.647205249588605
 back to barracks          1069.371881044399
 he said sternly          727.2451062951924
 he added in a preachers tone for this o dearly beloved is the genuine christine body and soul and blood and ouns          6.591667946777324
 slow music please          3383.82373351108

 a little trouble about those white corpuscles          31.433113269659046
 silence all          1033.4244044374339
 he peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call then paused awhile in rapt attention his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points          6.533763991262047
 chrysostomos          128491.49999999999
 two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm          47.95677417690508
 thanks old chap he cried briskly          91.11916583304716

 switch off the current will you          51.81957375449528
 he skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher gathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown          9.104703169148403
 the plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate patron of arts in the middle ages          10.507691770128824
 a pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips          30.874281119236276
 he said gaily          658.2210950597263
 your absurd name an ancient greek          87.33820387671734
 he pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet laughing to himself          6.207282996057071
 stephen dedalus stepped up followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck          5.344809311645705
 buck mulligans gay voice went on          179.21002018312268
 my name is absurd too malachi mulligan two dactyls          17.858618629403566
 but it has a hellenic ring hasnt it          20.288796481833614

 he laid the brush aside and laughing with delight cried will he come          8.976962732717002
 the jejune jesuit          3756.901894590172
 ceasing he began to shave with care          63.06171847165693

 how long is haines going to stay in this tower          16.71987915282252
 buck mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder          26.595685961149016
 he said frankly          865.9129851000407
 a ponderous saxon          3178.4352411352993
 he thinks youre not a gentleman          38.297504058637294

 because he comes from oxford          84.82415098650208

 o my name for you is the best kinch the knifeblade          14.636744297277218
 he shaved warily over his chin          136.06853921007516
 he was raving all night about a black panther stephen said          16.844529486048295
 where is his guncase          77.10695972932886
 a woful lunatic          5988.59463791301
 mulligan said          705.865238151906

 if he stays on here i am off          29.69205114775733
 buck mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade          42.23869031891499
 he hopped down from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily          9.140605910082295
 scutter          256982.99999999997
 he cried thickly          1743.3213232463659
 he came over to the gunrest and thrusting a hand into stephens upper pocket said lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor          6.281973987918064
 stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a dirty crumpled handkerchief          9.647034904240478
 buck mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly          141.78860000598675
 then gazing over the handkerchief he said the bards noserag          22.101445082044666
 a new art colour for our irish poets snotgreen          21.168759243644132
 you can almost taste it cant you          42.46593491633729
 he said quietly          510.8524851484097
 isnt the sea what algy calls it a great sweet mother          14.189145713282175
 the snotgreen sea          1249.569147174456
 the scrotumtightening sea          2023.4531630715783
 epi oinopa ponton          103453.86615960377

 come and look          288.84903840018086
 stephen stood up and went over to the parapet          11.446084133294997
 leaning on it he looked down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of kingstown          7.8205705579034035
 our mighty mother          2735.8369231926863
 buck mulligan said          1244.3594199601957
 he turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to stephens face          14.906303436876774
 the aunt thinks you killed your mother he said          13.058061454919466
 thats why she wont let me have anything to do with you          10.08507307275756
 someone killed her stephen said gloomily          74.0896380029549
 you could have knelt down damn it kinch when your dying mother asked you buck mulligan said          8.047967333296803
 im hyperborean as much as you          114.12363422301534
 but to think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for her          6.4846760747021905
 and you refused          626.6183802667467
 there is something sinister in you          39.58204543414707
 he broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek          17.091258683051763
 a tolerant smile curled his lips          110.72920066669516
 but a lovely mummer          115.85403866707746
 he murmured to himself          100.73869574760649
 kinch the loveliest mummer of them all          72.52202486785977
 he shaved evenly and with care in silence seriously          43.48468487998499
 stephen an elbow rested on the jagged granite leaned his palm against his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coatsleeve          7.661803407970846
 pain that was not yet the pain of love fretted his heart          12.553721332015105
 silently in a dream she had come to him after her death her wasted body within its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood her breath that had bent upon him mute reproachful a faint odour of wetted ashes          2.8986653516171637
 across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him          9.862872131463781
 the ring of bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid          8.52801124858934
 a bowl of white china had stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting          5.939815529134844
 buck mulligan wiped again his razorblade          145.66025040352326
 he said in a kind voice          14.798771065333433
 i must give you a shirt and a few noserags          17.30547307051375

 they fit well enough stephen answered          68.6878319615506
 buck mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip          83.6233379638053
 the mockery of it he said contentedly          19.512868299681593
 secondleg they should be          732.7294741004587
 god knows what poxy bowsy left them off          33.12398701149588

 thanks stephen said          763.8699663858301
 i cant wear them if they are grey          36.14155993761128
 he cant wear them buck mulligan told his face in the mirror          14.43124219628372
 etiquette is etiquette          5706.506923882336
 he kills his mother but he cant wear grey trousers          16.37839730795583
 he folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the smooth skin          8.867433120899006
 stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its smokeblue mobile eyes          7.723633675196334
 that fellow i was with in the ship last night said buck mulligan says you have g          8.15070699678659

 general paralysis of the insane          149.3687141718211
 he swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea          6.161369010029225
 his curling shaven lips laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth          18.507992336750057
 laughter seized all his strong wellknit trunk          64.94303085872548
 look at yourself he said you dreadful bard          30.543138652041666
 stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him cleft by a crooked crack          10.878849369660239
 hair on end          764.1794683695924
 as he and others see me          17.49782750206449
 who chose this face for me          79.95651383850763
 this dogsbody to rid of vermin          62.01918349640144
 it asks me too          242.19351302925534
 i pinched it out of the skivvys room buck mulligan said          14.487834689408858
 it does her all right          51.347242026549196
 the aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for malachi          26.039043734086082
 lead him not into temptation          101.66651841635807
 and her name is ursula          35.95428897892729
 laughing again he brought the mirror away from stephens peering eyes          14.734700347884086
 the rage of caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror he said          7.963558013615364
 if wilde were only alive to see you          38.44817150804535
 drawing back and pointing stephen said with bitterness it is a symbol of irish art          8.874128517152203
 the cracked lookingglass of a servant          39.186242153571314
 buck mulligan suddenly linked his arm in stephens and walked with him round the tower his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he had thrust them          7.802752211081031
 its not fair to tease you like that kinch is it          16.153613657534713
 god knows you have more spirit than any of them          19.426865280761163

 the cold steel pen          193.80285221804067

 hes stinking with money and thinks youre not a gentleman          17.215638911960735
 his old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to zulus or some bloody swindle or other          8.790089265835466

 if he makes any noise here ill bring down seymour and well give him a ragging worse than they gave clive kempthorpe          7.766327419550758
 young shouts of moneyed voices in clive kempthorpes rooms          21.083509404396565
 palefaces they hold their ribs with laughter one clasping another          31.34841381175234
 o i shall expire          165.3633530893516

 i shall die          974.0723073029835
 with slit ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the table with trousers down at heels chased by ades of magdalen with the tailors shears          7.728873687818313
 a scared calfs face gilded with marmalade          71.7464696095894
 i dont want to be debagged          24.199333278272
 dont you play the giddy ox with me          30.585521169926512
 shouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle          14.566495354463134
 a deaf gardener aproned masked with matthew arnolds face pushes his mower on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms          7.936210038372487
 new paganism          20302.70557531014
 omphalos          64245.74999999999
 let him stay stephen said          131.64051276519993
 theres nothing wrong with him except at night          45.460694579616245
 then what is it          91.50612318240084
 buck mulligan asked impatiently          477.86913651849846
 cough it up          836.1096965711528

 what have you against me now          34.271884188093004
 they halted looking towards the blunt cape of bray head that lay on the water like the snout of a sleeping whale          8.266797025865985
 stephen freed his arm quietly          101.74211125126772
 do you wish me to tell you          40.84505390675167
 yes what is it          110.1423751588424
 buck mulligan answered          2800.3685488272363
 i dont remember anything          231.62442192814015
 he looked in stephens face as he spoke          15.86812560764896
 a light wind passed his brow fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of anxiety in his eyes          7.78057470611425
 stephen depressed by his own voice said do you remember the first day i went to your house after my mothers death          8.683083609439556
 buck mulligan frowned quickly and said what          84.39871565954738
 where          842.567213114754
 i cant remember anything          274.4241022747953

 you were making tea stephen said and went across the landing to get more hot water          9.72331326723956
 your mother and some visitor came out of the drawingroom          11.550541792565847
 she asked you who was in your room          21.315101758408645

 a flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to buck mulligans cheek          10.715058883996466
 did i say that          130.0088217849604
 what harm is that          219.6894018645245
 he shook his constraint from him nervously          24.490537856987174
 and what is death he asked your mothers or yours or my own          8.62100519331701

 it simply doesnt matter          286.707632362645

 her cerebral lobes are not functioning          185.5521648121642
 she calls the doctor sir peter teazle and picks buttercups off the quilt          10.072616477976311

 you crossed her last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because i dont whinge like some hired mute from lalouettes          7.161701668393426

 he had spoken himself into boldness          50.41058528774652
 stephen shielding the gaping wounds which the words had left in his heart said very coldly i am not thinking of the offence to my mother          7.003469052885737
 of what then          157.48857624503094

 of the offence to me stephen answered          19.598741609187407
 buck mulligan swung round on his heel          89.0435477348602
 o an impossible person          369.88182020492326
 he exclaimed          1329.9187503857765
 he walked off quickly round the parapet          29.10492360996243
 stephen stood at his post gazing over the calm sea towards the headland          11.833978402142707
 sea and headland now grew dim          74.5657558714212
 pulses were beating in his eyes veiling their sight and he felt the fever of his cheeks          14.4394564242592
 a voice within the tower called loudly are you up there mulligan          12.9288986909696
 im coming buck mulligan answered          135.697813260994

 the sassenach wants his morning rashers          98.49445448746266
 his head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase level with the roof dont mope over it all day he said          5.2771905530284355
 im inconsequent          10264.991234036708

 his head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of the stairhead and no more turn aside and brood upon loves bitter mystery for fergus rules the brazen cars          4.753238238428231
 woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the stairhead seaward where he gazed          22.3795841637943
 inshore and farther out the mirror of water whitened spurned by lightshod hurrying feet          16.217309739171025
 white breast of the dim sea          44.463203590982
 the twining stresses two by two          139.00872882010015
 a hand plucking the harpstrings merging their twining chords          27.147511715038377
 wavewhite wedded words shimmering on the dim tide          103.20807380188855
 a cloud began to cover the sun slowly wholly shadowing the bay in deeper green          6.5797446581641
 it lay beneath him a bowl of bitter waters          25.915722282902188
 fergus song i sang it alone in the house holding down the long dark chords          13.949848048545503
 her door was open she wanted to hear my music          14.537072973290528
 silent with awe and pity i went to her bedside          25.112483132643632
 she was crying in her wretched bed          37.00038304169086
 for those words stephen loves bitter mystery          31.556179811846885
 where now          641.7468647728197
 her secrets old featherfans tasselled dancecards powdered with musk a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer          9.356892070906639
 a birdcage hung in the sunny window of her house when she was a girl          13.83819711521501
 she heard old royce sing in the pantomime of turko the terrible and laughed with others when he sang i am the boy that can enjoy invisibility          6.587074393065161
 phantasmal mirth folded away muskperfumed          813.572810233605
 and no more turn aside and brood          6.015345082475409
 folded away in the memory of nature with her toys          17.273396249387584
 memories beset his brooding brain          370.20859087406285
 her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had approached the sacrament          8.246529004969608
 a cored apple filled with brown sugar roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening          12.733942166590996
 her shapely fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the childrens shirts          20.649791310051263
 in a dream silently she had come to him her wasted body within its loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood her breath bent over him with mute secret words a faint odour of wetted ashes          2.8467426256517068
 her glazing eyes staring out of death to shake and bend my soul          17.143976665497043
 on me alone          463.28371401949397

 ghostly light on the tortured face          89.60490337393806
 her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror while all prayed on their knees          16.80559010805946
 her eyes on me to strike me down          16.63179799701055

 buck mulligans voice sang from within the tower          53.0254489973964
 it came nearer up the staircase calling again          30.07306753402802
 stephen still trembling at his souls cry heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words          10.193896771086214
 dedalus come down like a good mosey          37.18958599343371

 well have a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids          13.223591311203263
 he flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs singing out of tune with a cockney accent o wont we have a merry time drinking whisky beer and wine          3.6043029568999336
 on coronation coronation day          1235.1929303440024
 o wont we have a merry time on coronation day          9.151348105802667
 warm sunshine merrying over the sea          339.4743451605376
 the nickel shavingbowl shone forgotten on the parapet          53.435416799709266
 why should i bring it down          50.840444027871165
 or leave it there all day forgotten friendship          22.573961261324076
 he went over to it held it in his hands awhile feeling its coolness smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck          5.853626717900074
 so i carried the boat of incense then at clongowes          17.78036604395156

 a server of a servant          51.94398363110061
 in the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower buck mulligans gowned form moved briskly to and fro about the hearth hiding and revealing its yellow glow          6.471938895954831
 two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor from the high barbacans and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated turning          6.0661949161235125
 well be choked buck mulligan said          84.22321565497889
 haines open that door will you          53.47986991746751
 stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker          24.29609699175926
 a tall figure rose from the hammock where it had been sitting went to the doorway and pulled open the inner doors          7.970919011683809

 its in the lock stephen said coming forward          11.765221178739328
 the key scraped round harshly twice and when the heavy door had been set ajar welcome light and bright air entered          9.20503745323799
 haines stood at the doorway looking out          40.52047139671481
 stephen haled his upended valise to the table and sat down to wait          15.789825494948415
 buck mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him          26.771267647015485
 then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table set them down heavily and sighed with relief          7.226733812383062
 im melting he said as the candle remarked when          26.81960329534124

 stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from the locker          9.641276305789567
 buck mulligan sat down in a sudden pet          39.49523643198659
 what sort of a kip is this          20.979187260817543

 the blessings of god on you          41.41608096247422

 he hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three plates saying in nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti          8.474296650194997
 haines sat down to pour out the tea          31.463222564912893

 but i say mulligan you do make strong tea dont you          13.315131539535352
 buck mulligan hewing thick slices from the loaf said in an old womans wheedling voice when i makes tea i makes tea as old mother grogan said          9.252185185710436

 he lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread impaled on his knife          13.037964647918535
 thats folk he said very earnestly for your book haines          20.823990980989553
 five lines of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of dundrum          9.12221336800226
 printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind          7.425663132672461
 he turned to stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice lifting his brows can you recall brother is mother grogans tea and water pot spoken of in the mabinogion or is it in the upanishads          4.221800062310236

 do you now          392.15055635920106
 buck mulligan said in the same tone          35.827973542868385
 i fancy stephen said as he ate it did not exist in or out of the mabinogion          8.084062156493546
 mother grogan was one imagines a kinswoman of mary ann          25.98395588736657
 buck mulligans face smiled with delight          122.6469348697883
 charming          19767.923076923078
 he said in a finical sweet voice showing his white teeth and blinking his eyes pleasantly          6.399199668915633
 do you think she was          80.7732239846287
 quite charming          6663.805039268232
 then suddenly overclouding all his features he growled in a hoarsened rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf for old mary ann she doesnt care a damn          8.17687342354321
 but hising up her petticoats          150.00261722090457
 he crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned          17.401299706049787
 the doorway was darkened by an entering form          19.322396960848486

 ah to be sure          116.98044424567921
 stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker          20.476668649257565
 the islanders mulligan said to haines casually speak frequently of the collector of prepuces          14.308058961701528
 how much sir          1085.3072745004354

 she poured again a measureful and a tilly          30.906404824077825
 old and secret she had entered from a morning world maybe a messenger          11.194129775229651
 crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field a witch on her toadstool her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs          7.25653059804903
 they lowed about her whom they knew dewsilky cattle          34.22499659023902
 silk of the kine and poor old woman names given her in old times          7.333905867361841
 a wandering crone lowly form of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer their common cuckquean a messenger from the secret morning          8.734381929612754
 to serve or to upbraid whether he could not tell but scorned to beg her favour          9.714171391341049

 he drank at her bidding          58.93120361764973
 if we could live on good food like that he said to her somewhat loudly we wouldnt have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten guts          6.364065453200659
 living in a bogswamp eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust horsedung and consumptives spits          7.7048008402121635

 look at that now she said          31.686877441200636
 stephen listened in scornful silence          77.55767183886422
 she bows her old head to a voice that speaks to her loudly her bonesetter her medicineman me she slights          8.459457640012644
 to the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there is of her but her womans unclean loins of mans flesh made not in gods likeness the serpents prey          5.272904552506304
 and to the loud voice that now bids her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes          5.902508937014106
 do you understand what he says          59.12171741970782
 stephen asked her          392.8738672156769

 the old woman said to haines          19.739707265809876
 haines spoke to her again a longer speech confidently          22.991210571148446

 bill sir          3761.2041847602136

 well its seven mornings a pint at twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling          6.721388655234227
 thats a shilling and one and two is two and two sir          14.787571700170567
 buck mulligan sighed and having filled his mouth with a crust thickly buttered on both sides stretched forth his legs and began to search his trouser pockets          6.434058537643113
 pay up and look pleasant haines said to him smiling          14.334325842113625
 stephen filled a third cup a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thick rich milk          10.093550186194404
 buck mulligan brought up a florin twisted it round in his fingers and cried a miracle          12.89767784158105
 he passed it along the table towards the old woman saying ask nothing more of me sweet          6.548344377375538
 all i can give you i give          18.611157487977085

 she curtseyed and went out followed by buck mulligans tender chant heart of my heart were it more more would be laid at your feet          7.698082857096096
 im stony          5736.48755110472

 our swim first buck mulligan said          88.3001765996355
 he turned to stephen and asked blandly is this the day for your monthly wash kinch          5.282384921543166
 then he said to haines the unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month          7.959068995317237
 all ireland is washed by the gulfstream stephen said as he let honey trickle over a slice of the loaf          5.9074026512562385
 haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke i intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me          5.221825647135196
 speaking to me          431.2945279762127

 that one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol of irish art is deuced good          4.369425604038905
 buck mulligan kicked stephens foot under the table and said with warmth of tone wait till you hear him on hamlet haines          8.368368279143166
 well i mean it haines said still speaking to stephen          18.71629500410892
 i was just thinking of it when that poor old creature came in          9.024001738445035
 would i make any money by it          29.971702915756982
 haines laughed and as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of the hammock said i dont know im sure          7.688787168021027
 he strolled out to the doorway          53.03446344542802
 buck mulligan bent across to stephen and said with coarse vigour you put your hoof in it now          10.022778035200602
 what did you say that for          34.94717419926185
 stephen said          405.8842921698372
 the problem is to get money          35.67181448729356
 from whom          1068.6557724913432
 its a toss up i think          58.01299557117979
 i blow him out about you buck mulligan said and then you come along with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes          6.337813230553684
 i see little hope stephen said from her or from him          14.180369091142085
 buck mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on stephens arm          27.923888427989436
 from me kinch he said          86.7862433826147
 in a suddenly changed tone he added to tell you the gods truth i think youre right          7.252143093890215
 damn all else they are good for          50.89341352414325
 why dont you play them as i do          26.910102862317338
 let us get out of the kip          41.433639910263146
 he stood up gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown saying resignedly mulligan is stripped of his garments          7.691472985760936
 he emptied his pockets on to the table          23.036463973556117
 theres your snotrag he said          336.1413104667801
 and putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them chiding them and to his dangling watchchain          7.139977208326002
 his hands plunged and rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief          12.729380057915739
 god well simply have to dress the character          33.434450314277505

 very well then i contradict myself          49.099879700246625
 mercurial malachi          21340.91547496875
 a limp black missile flew out of his talking hands          18.95817865312154
 and theres your latin quarter hat he said          19.79122800137388
 stephen picked it up and put it on          20.78523620531423
 haines called to them from the doorway are you coming you fellows          13.64836508148956
 im ready buck mulligan answered going towards the door          32.78967237232388

 you have eaten all we left i suppose          18.50075538349633
 resigned he passed out with grave words and gait saying wellnigh with sorrow and going forth he met butterly          10.8736912826006
 stephen taking his ashplant from its leaningplace followed them out and as they went down the ladder pulled to the slow iron door and locked it          6.584697292970923
 he put the huge key in his inner pocket          12.017534451076129
 at the foot of the ladder buck mulligan asked did you bring the key          6.111326513124042
 i have it stephen said preceding them          20.63564480579167
 behind him he heard buck mulligan club with his heavy bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses          7.8165955973325385
 down sir          786.4025226968105
 how dare you sir          212.41087810392102
 haines asked do you pay rent for this tower          27.73840782885324
 twelve quid buck mulligan said          271.32584197676607
 to the secretary of state for war stephen added over his shoulder          9.600587264924078
 they halted while haines surveyed the tower and said at last rather bleak in wintertime i should say          9.825057732007812
 billy pitt had them built buck mulligan said when the french were on the sea          14.528113506269515
 but ours is the omphalos          99.68107584340444
 what is your idea of hamlet          33.39214647330463
 haines asked stephen          1261.934193175275
 no no buck mulligan shouted in pain          34.6380916107635
 im not equal to thomas aquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up          10.334511980285486
 wait till i have a few pints in me first          15.7330917200632
 he turned to stephen saying as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his primrose waistcoat you couldnt manage it under three pints kinch could you          5.407479891542179
 it has waited so long stephen said listlessly it can wait longer          15.272305312889769
 you pique my curiosity haines said amiably          57.17628796877193
 is it some paradox          81.93366977881303
 pooh          85661.0
 buck mulligan said          1244.3594199601957
 we have grown out of wilde and paradoxes          39.80824976987715
 its quite simple          1665.3422660429378
 he proves by algebra that hamlets grandson is shakespeares grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own father          5.628141143568992
 haines said beginning to point at stephen          57.18451270276675
 he himself          230.73597588729706
 buck mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and bending in loose laughter said to stephens ear o shade of kinch the elder          8.998013872807695
 japhet in search of a father          129.41899887797626
 were always tired in the morning stephen said to haines          22.372397551701276
 and it is rather long to tell          14.673192728348184
 buck mulligan walking forward again raised his hands          46.65314976352749
 the sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of dedalus he said          16.038962298075823
 i mean to say haines explained to stephen as they followed this tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of elsinore          6.509246103795377
 that beetles oer his base into the sea isnt it          26.82935527815576
 buck mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards stephen but did not speak          17.25626620348819
 in the bright silent instant stephen saw his own image in cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires          7.539583370218765
 its a wonderful tale haines said bringing them to halt again          15.297273088941362
 eyes pale as the sea the wind had freshened paler firm and prudent          13.160356654765964
 the seas ruler he gazed southward over the bay empty save for the smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tacking by the muglins          7.403101581426867
 i read a theological interpretation of it somewhere he said bemused          11.240997244657136
 the father and the son idea          16.54876644279129
 the son striving to be atoned with the father          31.974971859053923
 buck mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face          17.85605728834555
 he looked at them his wellshaped mouth open happily his eyes from which he had suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense blinking with mad gaiety          6.176443276389503
 he moved a dolls head to and fro the brims of his panama hat quivering and began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice im the queerest young fellow that ever you heard          5.181363533880492
 my mothers a jew my fathers a bird          21.527254313664873
 with joseph the joiner i cannot agree          17.88543508386508
 so heres to disciples and calvary          44.85073052483862
 he held up a forefinger of warning          25.717295714577375
 if anyone thinks that i amnt divine hell get no free drinks when im making the wine but have to drink water and wish it were plain that i make when the wine becomes water again          6.755351785341263
 he tugged swiftly at stephens ashplant in farewell and running forward to a brow of the cliff fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or wings of one about to rise in the air and chanted goodbye now goodbye          5.6562364311193845
 write down all i said and tell tom dick and harry i rose from the dead          9.026754764086096
 whats bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly and olivets breezy          11.807640999380093
 goodbye now goodbye          3974.418108371345
 he capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole fluttering his winglike hands leaping nimbly mercurys hat quivering in the fresh wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries          7.1851569426803845
 haines who had been laughing guardedly walked on beside stephen and said we oughtnt to laugh i suppose          9.217988885444155
 hes rather blasphemous          9141.316982991812
 im not a believer myself that is to say          10.875509659259448
 still his gaiety takes the harm out of it somehow doesnt it          12.497660096083695
 what did he call it          47.28701820177798
 the ballad of joking jesus stephen answered          20.610297163998975
 three times a day after meals stephen said drily          19.23055417760366
 youre not a believer are you          34.417346175612366
 haines asked          2421.109892887595
 i mean a believer in the narrow sense of the word          9.862062611880006
 creation from nothing and miracles and a personal god          29.817173150109063
 theres only one sense of the word it seems to me stephen said          9.177425784101992
 he sprang it open with his thumb and offered it          15.207775548073327
 thank you stephen said taking a cigarette          42.30823854225478
 haines helped himself and snapped the case to          44.552850979696096
 he put it back in his sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox sprang it open too and having lit his cigarette held the flaming spunk towards stephen in the shell of his hands          4.386736063595691
 yes of course he said as they went on again          12.606350529184494
 either you believe or you dont isnt it          33.77817491561021
 personally i couldnt stomach that idea of a personal god          24.89231622378366
 you dont stand for that i suppose          44.67496224944026
 you behold in me stephen said with grim displeasure a horrible example of free thought          9.823676969602355
 he walked on waiting to be spoken to trailing his ashplant by his side          9.41192644033408
 its ferrule followed lightly on the path squealing at his heels          29.372186261529468
 my familiar after me calling steeeeeeeeeeeephen          64.52221113790831
 a wavering line along the path          104.13969725857127

 after all haines began          198.33923791084956
 stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not all unkind          8.45034088176219
 after all i should think you are able to free yourself          11.786192819560066

 the imperial british state stephen answered his colour rising and the holy roman catholic and apostolic church          9.774554851965885
 haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he spoke          18.79019384666963
 i can quite understand that he said calmly          27.666473404128293

 the proud potent titles clanged over stephens memory the triumph of their brazen bells et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts a chemistry of stars          6.028769517703001

 a horde of heresies fleeing with mitres awry photius and the brood of mockers of whom mulligan was one and arius warring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the son with the father and valentine spurning christs terrene body and the subtle african heresiarch sabellius who held that the father was himself his own son          3.8451320466767944

 shes making for bullock harbour          103.02644565946981
 the boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain          17.15770715324694

 they followed the winding path down to the creek          14.602144577439075
 buck mulligan stood on a stone in shirtsleeves his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder          14.26473792276767
 a young man clinging to a spur of rock near him moved slowly frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water          6.385956973057074

 buck mulligan sat down to unlace his boots          39.59221936990357
 an elderly man shot up near the spur of rock a blowing red face          13.804541344809982
 he scrambled up by the stones water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair water rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black sagging loincloth          6.172518551080502
 buck mulligan made way for him to scramble past and glancing at haines and stephen crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips and breastbone          7.666861700036792

 he nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up saying tritely redheaded women buck like goats          7.357264561622229
 he broke off in alarm feeling his side under his flapping shirt          13.401373466065554

 the young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the middle of the creek in two long clean strokes          5.945228096359785
 haines sat down on a stone smoking          54.34426048069246

 buck mulligan laid it across his heaped clothes          47.013901474963966
 and twopence he said for a pint          20.307802484127816
 throw it there          590.5175244399486

 dressing undressing          34688.544630977165

 thus spake zarathustra          35170.93450152549
 his plump body plunged          256.5990038409729
 well see you again haines said turning as stephen walked up the path and smiling at wild irish          8.532329310967773

 a voice sweettoned and sustained called to him from the sea          21.75193713436735
 turning the curve he waved his hand          48.28601222071873
 it called again          480.8729980503776

 he curled them between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly          13.849484657906793
 crumbs adhered to the tissue of his lips          48.82130496901195

 a thing out in the water          27.54771667033458

 some laughed again mirthless but with meaning          43.68932526088715
 two in the back bench whispered          17.169153423385602

 the words troubled their gaze          96.2337711816868
 how sir          995.5589675959536

 noone here to hear          152.59097868787347
 tonight deftly amid wild drink and talk to pierce the polished mail of his mind          17.285739857412228
 what then          357.24289348787886
 a jester at the court of his master indulged and disesteemed winning a clement masters praise          9.92605131475115
 why had they chosen all that part          30.005802385779344
 not wholly for the smooth caress          57.88461560464363
 for them too history was a tale like any other too often heard their land a pawnshop          8.115300175294793
 had pyrrhus not fallen by a beldams hand in argos or julius caesar not been knifed to death          10.072590950570339
 they are not to be thought away          19.48883315513836
 time has branded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite possibilities they have ousted          10.282016487073742
 but can those have been possible seeing that they never were          15.863389790268085
 or was that only possible which came to pass          12.818313565998467

 stephen asked opening another book          146.05301489492754

 a swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork of his satchel          12.908169791149875
 it must be a movement then an actuality of the possible as possible          8.701444138516859
 aristotles phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated out into the studious silence of the library of saint genevieve where he had read sheltered from the sin of paris night by night          8.600678511109193
 by his elbow a delicate siamese conned a handbook of strategy          15.094498383953306
 fed and feeding brains about me under glowlamps impaled with faintly beating feelers and in my minds darkness a sloth of the underworld reluctant shy of brightness shifting her dragon scaly folds          6.971872713307337

 talbot repeated through the dear might of him that walked the waves through the dear might          8.409404165068073
 turn over stephen said quietly          94.94957873940946

 talbot asked simply bending forward          242.60192457814807
 his hand turned the page over          41.573730728154445
 he leaned back and went on again having just remembered          18.44948214988183
 of him that walked the waves          7.835697998157411
 here also over these craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffers heart and lips and on mine          8.749256471496231
 it lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the tribute          11.928848712392522

 they bundled their books away pencils clacking pages rustling          29.036187907733883
 crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels all gabbling gaily a riddle sir          17.26294284396426

 after a silence cochrane said what is it sir          19.632423860750187

 stephen his throat itching answered the fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush          12.648247031724816
 he stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries echoed dismay          7.993478045673772
 a stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called hockey          13.5763581254355
 they broke asunder sidling out of their benches leaping them          30.955205446241038
 quickly they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and clamour of their boots and tongues          8.022062774516446
 sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly showing an open copybook          20.769554299192603
 his tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading          9.185678576012005
 on his cheek dull and bloodless a soft stain of ink lay dateshaped recent and damp as a snails bed          7.805401447333774
 he held out his copybook          55.30178200505758
 the word sums was written on the headline          41.663605924774096
 beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with blind loops and a blot          12.91347679704069
 cyril sargent his name and seal          153.49034415911407
 mr deasy told me to write them out all again he said and show them to you sir          11.230366597811257
 stephen touched the edges of the book          25.08551460613315

 mr deasy said i was to copy them off the board sir          16.546410379147687
 can you do them yourself          71.32236082552318
 no sir          614.1553828276824
 ugly and futile lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink a snails bed          15.053022905538908
 yet someone had loved him borne him in her arms and in her heart          13.335850397220794
 but for her the race of the world would have trampled him underfoot a squashed boneless snail          7.301870511054906
 she had loved his weak watery blood drained from her own          16.544260256600158
 was that then real          62.893068550960145
 his mothers prostrate body the fiery columbanus in holy zeal bestrode          22.88446563128281
 she was no more the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the fire an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes          6.801537119018793
 she had saved him from being trampled underfoot and had gone scarcely having been          12.519060580888388
 a poor soul gone to heaven and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox red reek of rapine in his fur with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth listened scraped up the earth listened scraped and scraped          5.107233663433476
 sitting at his side stephen solved out the problem          16.765061291843118
 he proves by algebra that shakespeares ghost is hamlets grandfather          14.213165844355126
 sargent peered askance through his slanted glasses          166.3033606057774
 hockeysticks rattled in the lumberroom the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field          14.00789490029667
 across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice in the mummery of their letters wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes          7.808655564655216
 give hands traverse bow to partner so imps of fancy of the moors          18.872932190541462
 gone too from the world averroes and moses maimonides dark men in mien and movement flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the world a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not comprehend          5.2126983067756845

 yes sir          903.663455813134
 in long shaky strokes sargent copied the data          32.438074968510385
 waiting always for a word of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols a faint hue of shame flickering behind his dull skin          7.356329678383574
 amor matris subjective and objective genitive          329.03381738129855

 too far for me to lay a hand there once or lightly          12.651476011997481
 mine is far and his secret as our eyes          24.430520699284543
 secrets silent stony sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts secrets weary of their tyranny tyrants willing to be dethroned          11.309224191441901
 the sum was done          100.74366862674896
 it is very simple stephen said as he stood up          10.909250493009454
 yes sir          903.663455813134
 thanks sargent answered          6423.6194954489
 he dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his copybook back to his bench          7.850275262988867
 you had better get your stick and go out to the others stephen said as he followed towards the door the boys graceless form          6.234614652263937
 yes sir          903.663455813134
 in the corridor his name was heard called from the playfield          14.695927485839475
 sargent          36711.857142857145

 mr deasy is calling you          118.58497025015232
 he stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy field where sharp voices were in strife          6.766975805566115
 they were sorted in teams and mr deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet          10.884902757068549
 when he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to him          9.478873303025551
 he turned his angry white moustache          27.512498598791186
 what is it now          46.24590940904128
 he cried continually without listening          183.79131382324445
 cochrane and halliday are on the same side sir stephen said          27.037076230279016
 will you wait in my study for a moment mr deasy said till i restore order here          9.684813615538996
 and as he stepped fussily back across the field his old mans voice cried sternly what is the matter          6.1467001408226425
 what is it now          46.24590940904128
 their sharp voices cried about him on all sides their many forms closed round him the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed head          8.286543883003464
 stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded leather of its chairs          15.187723914845087
 as on the first day he bargained with me here          9.327247963849379
 as it was in the beginning is now          9.568697545978955
 on the sideboard the tray of stuart coins base treasure of a bog and ever shall be          7.955450824080066
 and snug in their spooncase of purple plush faded the twelve apostles having preached to all the gentiles world without end          7.044290557362221
 a hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor          19.531791455835194
 first our little financial settlement he said          36.19253518834066
 he brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong          10.447546718578943
 it slapped open and he took from it two notes one of joined halves and laid them carefully on the table          8.838785665954699
 two he said strapping and stowing his pocketbook away          14.479037257079076
 and now his strongroom for the gold          14.800227886568107
 stephens embarrassed hand moved over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar whelks and money cowries and leopard shells and this whorled as an emirs turban and this the scallop of saint james          7.362478096306301

 stephens hand free again went back to the hollow shells          23.798453890887256

 iago stephen murmured          6786.762187009955
 he lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old mans stare          9.12654466011402

 mr deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the shapely bulk of a man in tartan fillibegs albert edward prince of wales          8.898259523073463

 he went to the desk near the window pulled in his chair twice and read off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter          5.259939153935707
 sit down          1740.5302980708175

 just a moment          537.5432916379464
 he peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow and muttering began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly sometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error          5.655116203618531
 stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence          31.61646285389116

 he came to the table pinning together his sheets          12.555615581677039

 he stepped swiftly off his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a broad sunbeam          12.310337499389627
 he faced about and back again          54.50195127240098

 they sinned against the light mr deasy said gravely          23.305025391694798
 and you can see the darkness in their eyes          13.740592416769344
 and that is why they are wanderers on the earth to this day          7.681392383802926

 their full slow eyes belied the words the gestures eager and unoffending but knew the rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was vain          7.538313437577246
 vain patience to heap and hoard          86.3475332078658

 mr deasy asked          2554.461668424817
 he came forward a pace and stood by the table          16.207567172133814

 the ways of the creator are not our ways mr deasy said          8.485225964487302

 a shout in the street stephen answered shrugging his shoulders          13.919651903511623
 mr deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked between his fingers          10.096970402724889
 i am happier than you are he said          48.72974200893032

 stephen raised the sheets in his hand          20.173177172283427
 well sir he began          112.56717157632396

 perhaps i am wrong          234.18401718095234

 and here what will you learn more          20.92739009686468
 mr deasy shook his head          255.91784567479914
 who knows          1557.1928619646721
 he said          163.62812624064918
 to learn one must be humble          44.91424845563171
 but life is the great teacher          37.70103028932078
 stephen rustled the sheets again          85.54057081258576
 as regards these he began          152.1709676711333

 i like to break a lance with you old as i am          8.813490463169526
 good morning sir stephen said again bowing to his bent back          13.943380783052248
 he went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield          5.978090152770994
 the lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate toothless terrors          16.75996286883722

 yes sir stephen said turning back at the gate          21.720215032596897
 mr deasy halted breathing hard and swallowing his breath          38.79989593385545
 i just wanted to say he said          28.659590631553662
 ireland they say has the honour of being the only country which never persecuted the jews          10.182929557558854
 do you know that          69.19350330739059
 and do you know why          35.00310057599882
 he frowned sternly on the bright air          58.373888359447534
 why sir          1203.9416319078127
 stephen asked beginning to smile          148.76165352934058
 because she never let them in mr deasy said solemnly          13.510962908642206
 a coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a rattling chain of phlegm          9.851581110569017
 he turned back quickly coughing laughing his lifted arms waving to the air          11.096777414470353
 she never let them in he cried again through his laughter as he stamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path          6.494458567689555
 thats why          1677.5947559127553

 ii mr leopold bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls          11.795953369470839
 he liked thick giblet soup nutty gizzards a stuffed roast heart liverslices fried with crustcrumbs fried hencods roes          10.543892601983154
 most of all he liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of faintly scented urine          6.343255175659524
 kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly righting her breakfast things on the humpy tray          8.678409518249186
 gelid light and air were in the kitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere          12.175166783506693
 made him feel a bit peckish          56.198007994403625

 he turned from the tray lifted the kettle off the hob and set it sideways on the fire          6.955721281022864
 it sat there dull and squat its spout stuck out          16.446938047502822

 clean to see the gloss of her sleek hide the white button under the butt of her tail the green flashing eyes          7.318331087694702

 she blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes mewing plaintively and long showing him her milkwhite teeth          10.104439502423935
 he watched the dark eyeslits narrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones          8.976238587693555
 then he went to the dresser took the jug hanlons milkman had just filled for him poured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor          5.640494330755687
 gurrhr          256982.99999999997
 she cried running to lap          120.14517778767039
 wonder is it true if you clip them they cant mouse after          12.106858450301871
 they shine in the dark perhaps the tips          19.659187691875534
 or kind of feelers in the dark perhaps          13.86568130465771
 he listened to her licking lap          34.508929535878245
 ham and eggs no          429.0063377358923

 thursday not a good day either for a mutton kidney at buckleys          13.100176108327885

 while the kettle is boiling          74.84916167528338
 she lapped slower then licking the saucer clean          68.01487058371733
 why are their tongues so rough          44.380914795900225
 to lap better all porous holes          64.28934458445607
 nothing she can eat          216.45786452548137
 he glanced round him          195.25600284554002
 on quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall paused by the bedroom door          13.40101184427291
 she might like something tasty          66.39113038209004
 thin bread and butter she likes in the morning          24.739036096198976
 still perhaps once in a way          45.75381371557796
 he said softly in the bare hall im going round the corner          12.584296356815255
 be back in a minute          28.66376767150716
 and when he had heard his voice say it he added you dont want anything for breakfast          6.830525384752083
 a sleepy soft grunt answered mn          69.95433936838383
 she didnt want anything          271.7077454731512
 he heard then a warm heavy sigh softer as she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled          7.25814327874079
 must get those settled really          106.38723508123992

 she turned over sleepily that time          43.30333180367339
 he pulled the halldoor to after him very quietly more till the footleaf dropped gently over the threshold a limp lid          6.7986496669438425

 oldfashioned way he used to bow molly off the platform          25.770696163835574
 and the little mirror in his silk hat          12.253766642102587
 the night milly brought it into the parlour          23.745509666390532

 pert little piece she was          337.26439729270436
 he prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over then fitted the teapot on the tray          9.211568385069382
 its hump bumped as he took it up          71.16660220027234

 bread and butter four sugar spoon her cream          30.407749312786063
 he carried it upstairs his thumb hooked in the teapot handle          12.98491573942314
 nudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set it on the chair by the bedhead          7.011424891630607
 what a time you were          43.071395464052316

 she set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly an elbow on the pillow          8.528394704548356
 he looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large soft bubs sloping within her nightdress like a shegoats udder          8.839250496306448
 the warmth of her couched body rose on the air mingling with the fragrance of the tea she poured          6.769847345498771
 a strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow          13.19713551332191
 in the act of going he stayed to straighten the bedspread          8.94403930548335

 she doubled a slice of bread into her mouth asking what time is the funeral          8.34918351810978

 following the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soiled drawers from the bed          9.54961279777489
 then a twisted grey garter looped round a stocking rumpled shiny sole          13.71797006413124

 voglio e non vorrei          1318.8881676748938
 wonder if she pronounces that right voglio          33.823540569577865
 not in the bed          29.092763508291814

 he stooped and lifted the valance          34.73479393328459
 the book fallen sprawled against the bulge of the orangekeyed chamberpot          15.745571495700197

 she swallowed a draught of tea from her cup held by nothandle and having wiped her fingertips smartly on the blanket began to search the text with the hairpin till she reached the word          5.858930341877508

 she said          290.93548119225636
 he smiled glancing askance at her mocking eyes          36.35599131564563

 reincarnation thats the word          255.28821303138628

 he turned the pages back          31.10045072020505
 metempsychosis he said is what the ancient greeks called it          18.465264574364348
 they used to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree for instance          7.346077965161822
 what they called nymphs for example          44.319242410557834
 her spoon ceased to stir up the sugar          46.02134582251477
 she gazed straight before her inhaling through her arched nostrils          25.612160638406305

 he cried suddenly          825.8929124512048
 pungent smoke shot up in an angry jet from a side of the pan          18.66690216546851
 by prodding a prong of the fork under the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its back          8.884946570744141
 only a little burnt          100.58908728365448

 he shore away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat          14.446176913092357

 what was that about some young student and a picnic          11.644563094980128
 he creased out the letter at his side reading it slowly as he chewed sopping another die of bread in the gravy and raising it to his mouth          5.586754583301256

 no thanks professor machugh said waving the cigarettecase aside          28.20560504497295
 the finest display of oratory i ever heard was a speech made by john f taylor at the college historical society          9.676421010491621
 mr justice fitzgibbon the present lord justice of appeal had spoken and the paper under debate was an essay new for those days advocating the revival of the irish tongue          7.704041431948467
 he turned towards myles crawford and said you know gerald fitzgibbon          14.781527981251962
 then you can imagine the style of his discourse          17.899376606193496
 he is sitting with tim healy j          21.054226255876173
 omolloy said rumour has it on the trinity college estates commission          24.146780045171596
 he is sitting with a sweet thing myles crawford said in a childs frock          8.970587854831457
 go on          332.6738618005218
 it was the speech mark you the professor said of a finished orator full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction i will not say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud mans contumely upon the new movement          4.682203548752726
 it was then a new movement          27.13000530196363
 we were weak therefore worthless          121.44078473446768
 he closed his long thin lips an instant but eager to be on raised an outspanned hand to his spectacles and with trembling thumb and ringfinger touching lightly the black rims steadied them to a new focus          5.423571345134502
 impromptu in ferial tone he addressed j          116.38893290358835
 omolloy taylor had come there you must know from a sickbed          24.606835149937975
 that he had prepared his speech i do not believe for there was not even one shorthandwriter in the hall          6.5869538420177705
 his dark lean face had a growth of shaggy beard round it          16.218654020763765
 his gaze turned at once but slowly from j          22.976377322234512
 omolloys towards stephens face and then bent at once to the ground seeking          19.790203688945994
 his unglazed linen collar appeared behind his bent head soiled by his withering hair          18.98868015778431
 still seeking he said when fitzgibbons speech had ended john f taylor rose to reply          11.870433887236874
 briefly as well as i can bring them to mind his words were these          13.11922089109639
 he raised his head firmly          49.460090478067485
 his eyes bethought themselves once more          101.97464254837463
 witless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro seeking outlet          58.39017424573214
 he began mr chairman ladies and gentlemen great was my admiration in listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of ireland a moment since by my learned friend          5.617309605291973
 it seemed to me that i had been transported into a country far away from this country into an age remote from this age that i stood in ancient egypt and that i was listening to the speech of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful moses          4.561672371902543
 his listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear their smokes ascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech          10.573069217102372
 and let our crooked smokes          53.5539115549357

 could you try your hand at it yourself          28.633566672152288
 and it seemed to me that i heard the voice of that egyptian highpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride          3.836163665637561
 i heard his words and their meaning was revealed to me          10.177997026397469
 from the fathers it was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are corrupted which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they were good could be corrupted          5.690203548443166

 a dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech          61.93864328680979
 he would never have spoken with the eternal amid lightnings on sinais mountaintop nor ever have come down with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the tables of the law graven in the language of the outlaw          3.022467538311097

 well let me see if you can post a letter father conmee said          9.299847148303932
 master brunny lynam ran across the road and put father conmees letter to father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox          10.456107186798224
 father conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along mountjoy square east          15.871558238930698
 mr denis j maginni professor of dancing c in silk hat slate frockcoat with silk facings white kerchief tie tight lavender trousers canary gloves and pointed patent boots walking with grave deportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady maxwell at the corner of dignams court          4.329806493010009
 was that not mrs mguinness          33.835712556907815
 mrs mguinness stately silverhaired bowed to father conmee from the farther footpath along which she sailed          18.800501226909365
 and father conmee smiled and saluted          38.11146203145139
 how did she do          157.57544620790264
 a fine carriage she had          98.06633243943347
 like mary queen of scots something          82.14259856700626
 and to think that she was a pawnbroker          14.958681192965585
 such a          318.46380434319275
 what should he say          110.01394988349338
 such a queenly mien          354.3377597370567
 father conmee walked down great charles street and glanced at the shutup free church on his left          11.288873437434166
 the reverend t          1408.7929727876096
 greene b          19332.61139163382

 will d          1600.0717061544342
 speak          4758.944444444444
 the incumbent they called him          79.57073961441294
 he felt it incumbent on him to say a few words          10.839433103309242
 but one should be charitable          80.19534277629747
 they acted according to their lights          130.20362430230165
 father conmee turned the corner and walked along the north circular road          13.502860794286146
 it was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an important thoroughfare          5.085836280575474
 surely there ought to be          141.22571141979915
 a band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from richmond street          14.424172012590615
 all raised untidy caps          608.1943634312915
 father conmee greeted them more than once benignly          55.23650575674936
 christian brother boys          4894.924258808796
 father conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked          27.36425894627151
 saint josephs church portland row          441.14924866421336
 for aged and virtuous females          58.673387272582374
 father conmee raised his hat to the blessed sacrament          35.92609527678928
 virtuous but occasionally they were also badtempered          99.63845307071962
 near aldborough house father conmee thought of that spendthrift nobleman          26.74381355204233
 and now it was an office or something          11.065587822565638
 father conmee began to walk along the north strand road and was saluted by mr william gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop          8.422920999507655
 father conmee saluted mr william gallagher and perceived the odours that came from baconflitches and ample cools of butter          11.390339744019668
 he passed grogans the tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful catastrophe in new york          10.919537905303502
 in america those things were continually happening          36.54556364575325
 unfortunate people to die like that unprepared          45.61722475902742
 still an act of perfect contrition          66.46804869975306
 father conmee went by daniel bergins publichouse against the window of which two unlabouring men lounged          12.44702521992244
 they saluted him and were saluted          48.430055912887205
 father conmee passed h          475.92112381921635
 oneills funeral establishment where corny kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay          15.71314392209126
 a constable on his beat saluted father conmee and father conmee saluted the constable          10.092048437912489
 in youkstetters the porkbutchers father conmee observed pigs puddings white and black and red lie neatly curled in tubes          8.580375216113266
 moored under the trees of charleville mall father conmee saw a turfbarge a towhorse with pendent head a bargeman with a hat of dirty straw seated amidships smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above him          6.003197226842524
 it was idyllic and father conmee reflected on the providence of the creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor people          5.863586929860803
 on newcomen bridge the very reverend john conmee s          13.564661602007208
 of saint francis xaviers church upper gardiner street stepped on to an outward bound tram          10.961597794364685
 off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend nicholas dudley c          20.887579433439235
 of saint agathas church north william street on to newcomen bridge          24.00951017428584
 at newcomen bridge father conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past mud island          8.3889014092211
 father conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar a blue ticket tucked with care in the eye of one plump kid glove while four shillings a sixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse          5.705023213575619
 passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket          8.429280376846307
 the solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to father conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap          6.28223810761022
 father conmee liked cheerful decorum          233.53562002822878
 it was a peaceful day          25.35188453729275
 the gentleman with the glasses opposite father conmee had finished explaining and looked down          6.666906979375872
 his wife father conmee supposed          71.31722187998281
 a tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with the glasses          7.135615885213439
 she raised her small gloved fist yawned ever so gently tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily sweetly          6.345842524136147
 father conmee perceived her perfume in the car          52.26126608987041
 he perceived also that the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the seat          5.285926960299005
 father conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head          7.041937261705242
 at annesley bridge the tram halted and when it was about to go an old woman rose suddenly from her place to alight          9.9631834285735
 the conductor pulled the bellstrap to stay the car for her          19.653710784876765
 she passed out with her basket and a marketnet and father conmee saw the conductor help her and net and basket down and father conmee thought that as she had nearly passed the end of the penny fare she was one of those good souls who had always to be told twice bless you my child that they have been absolved pray for me          4.315211704553769
 but they had so many worries in life so many cares poor creatures          10.52371605841845
 from the hoardings mr eugene stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at father conmee          13.504888517683638
 father conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and of his sermon on saint peter claver s          5.356725508451482
 and the african mission and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their last hour came like a thief in the night          4.409523394785147
 that book by the belgian jesuit le nombre des élus seemed to father conmee a reasonable plea          6.6555949120405264
 those were millions of human souls created by god in his own likeness to whom the faith had not d          8.419803181953707
 been brought          1557.1729924560711
 but they were gods souls created by god          16.60632674602625
 it seemed to father conmee a pity that they should all be lost a waste if one might say          6.39224150804502
 at the howth road stop father conmee alighted was saluted by the conductor and saluted in his turn          8.397448181640431
 the malahide road was quiet          103.94417279286509
 it pleased father conmee road and name          38.5032465342483
 the joybells were ringing in gay malahide          41.598755608067655
 lord talbot de malahide immediate hereditary lord admiral of malahide and the seas adjoining          16.038762380650017
 then came the call to arms and she was maid wife and widow in one day          7.843198651582186
 those were old worldish days loyal times in joyous townlands old times in the barony          8.182401073056369
 father conmee walking thought of his little book old times in the barony and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of mary rochfort daughter of lord molesworth first countess of belvedere          5.762761207284161
 a listless lady no more young walked alone the shore of lough ennel mary first countess of belvedere listlessly walking in the evening not startled when an otter plunged          6.87285854241449
 who could know the truth          89.29877052342177
 not the jealous lord belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed adultery fully eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris with her husbands brother          6.537938286984826
 she would half confess if she had not all sinned as women did          11.042028057100856
 father conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence needed however for mans race on earth and of the ways of god which were not our ways          7.117800273742187
 he was humane and honoured there          60.917611225660444
 he bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at smiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom ceiled with full fruit clusters          6.758338165902004
 and the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom noble to noble were impalmed by don john conmee          5.71566349557337
 it was a charming day          25.355055565064614
 the lychgate of a field showed father conmee breadths of cabbages curtseying to him with ample underleaves          8.907659636976469
 the sky showed him a flock of small white clouds going slowly down the wind          11.88420637117913
 moutonner the french said          501.22483081192695
 a just and homely word          25.682123583344755
 father conmee reading his office watched a flock of muttoning clouds over rathcoffey          18.071643776382846
 his thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of clongowes field          33.48849760733337
 he walked there reading in the evening and heard the cries of the boys lines at their play young cries in the quiet evening          6.27878018307189
 he was their rector his reign was mild          14.896348619198674
 father conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out          20.46305101992258
 an ivory bookmark told him the page          86.78079847209307
 nones          128491.49999999999
 he should have read that before lunch          27.868107988929097
 but lady maxwell had come          275.8790721559878
 father conmee read in secret pater and ave and crossed his breast          18.569420750006323
 deus in adiutorium          7443.679099587117
 he walked calmly and read mutely the nones walking and reading till he came to res in beati immaculati principium verborum tuorum veritas in eternum omnia iudicia iustitiæ tuæ          7.0749944615999905
 a flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand          7.1677031521903185
 the young man raised his cap abruptly the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig          3.7270884044015764
 father conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his breviary          17.864132507838658
 sin principes persecuti sunt me gratis et a verbis tuis formidavit cor meum          37.99129991704629
 corny kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner          12.21086504483519
 he pulled himself erect went to it and spinning it on its axle viewed its shape and brass furnishings          8.824867384697889
 chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came to the doorway          11.632597744973044
 there he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes and leaned against the doorcase looking idly out          9.264080152252145
 father john conmee stepped into the dollymount tram on newcomen bridge          20.835263450573322
 corny kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed his hat downtilted chewing his blade of hay          14.16051574306557

 its very close the constable said          69.01860110399954
 corny kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth while a generous white arm from a window in eccles street flung forth a coin          9.651150611814034
 whats the best news          93.95125389232783
 i seen that particular party last evening the constable said with bated breath          10.81554670547796
 a onelegged sailor crutched himself round macconnells corner skirting rabaiottis icecream car and jerked himself up eccles street          11.625994649798235
 towards larry orourke in shirtsleeves in his doorway he growled unamiably for england          22.772892458909
 he swung himself violently forward past katey and boody dedalus halted and growled home and beauty          9.915946587662633
 omolloys white careworn face was told that mr lambert was in the warehouse with a visitor          18.543605773146233
 a stout lady stopped took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it into the cap held out to her          7.290972907639863
 the sailor grumbled thanks glanced sourly at the unheeding windows sank his head and swung himself forward four strides          11.291076358811424
 he halted and growled angrily for england          21.03536250071669
 two barefoot urchins sucking long liquorice laces halted near him gaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths          14.08065269449013
 he swung himself forward in vigorous jerks halted lifted his head towards a window and bayed deeply home and beauty          8.924071644965585
 the gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two ceased          12.590098172392533
 the blind of the window was drawn aside          13.21995952150424
 a card unfurnished apartments slipped from the sash and fell          22.38276314167675
 a plump bare generous arm shone was seen held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut shiftstraps          10.71473300574036

 for shame          1220.4419675826498
 a skiff a crumpled throwaway elijah is coming rode lightly down the liffey under loopline bridge shooting the rapids where water chafed around the bridgepiers sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains between the customhouse old dock and georges quay          5.127043807439756

 the empty castle car fronted them at rest in essex gate          17.16799738736121

 in inisfail the fair there lies a land the land of holy michan          12.207066615445456
 there sleep the mighty dead as in life they slept warriors and princes of high renown          8.474867437461974
 a pleasant land it is in sooth of murmuring waters fishful streams where sport the gurnard the plaice the roach the halibut the gibbed haddock the grilse the dab the brill the flounder the pollock the mixed coarse fish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too numerous to be enumerated          5.033176007429728
 in the mild breezes of the west and of the east the lofty trees wave in different directions their firstclass foliage the wafty sycamore the lebanonian cedar the exalted planetree the eugenic eucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal world with which that region is thoroughly well supplied          4.901263952184867
 and heroes voyage from afar to woo them from eblana to slievemargy the peerless princes of unfettered munster and of connacht the just and of smooth sleek leinster and of cruachans land and of armagh the splendid and of the noble district of boyle princes the sons of kings          5.5663071393021575
 and there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen by mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for that purpose and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits of that land for oconnell fitzsimon takes toll of them a chieftain descended from chieftains          5.144877643361693

 come out here geraghty you notorious bloody hill and dale robber          14.841636303171084
 and by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed ewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers and roaring mares and polled calves and longwools and storesheep and cuffes prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the various different varieties of highly distinguished swine and angus heifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime premiated milchcows and beeves and there is ever heard a trampling cackling roaring lowing bleating bellowing rumbling grunting champing chewing of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from pasturelands of lusk and rush and carrickmines and from the streamy vales of thomond from the mgillicuddys reeks the inaccessible and lordly shannon the unfathomable and from the gentle declivities of the place of the race of kiar their udders distended with superabundance of milk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmers firkins and targets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great hundreds various in size the agate with this dun          3.9088689736895454
 so we turned into barney kiernans and there sure enough was the citizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that bloody mangy mongrel garryowen and he waiting for what the sky would drop in the way of drink          5.18304796797182
 the bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps          10.945244532103482
 be a corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody dog          8.741110402611964
 im told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a constabulary man in santry that came round one time with a blue paper about a licence          6.134127321876254

 i think the markets are on a rise says he sliding his hand down his fork          7.911059905027146
 so begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says foreign wars is the cause of it          7.880232755098742

 and with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck and by jesus he near throttled him          5.071829692279136
 the figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero          5.529009851294559
 from shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike mountainous knees were covered as was likewise the rest of his body wherever visible with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse ulex europeus          4.947993506084044
 the widewinged nostrils from which bristles of the same tawny hue projected were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest          7.800982494814564
 the eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower          5.662583072017732
 a powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground the summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble          5.4175903504472736
 he wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited straw and rushes          5.599485379998255
 beneath this he wore trews of deerskin roughly stitched with gut          15.596471475316555
 from his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every movement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude yet striking art the tribal images of many irish heroes and heroines of antiquity cuchulin conn of hundred battles niall of nine hostages brian of kincora the ardri malachi art macmurragh shane oneill father john murphy owen roe patrick sarsfield red hugh odonnell red jim macdermott soggarth eoghan ogrowney michael dwyer francy higgins henry joy mcracken goliath horace wheatley thomas conneff peg woffington the village blacksmith captain moonlight captain boycott dante alighieri christopher columbus s          4.600941647599981

 hello bloom says he what will you have          25.301013704268033
 so they started arguing about the point bloom saying he wouldnt and he couldnt and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well hed just take a cigar          5.670393056975959
 gob hes a prudent member and no mistake          26.767544535537226
 give us one of your prime stinkers terry says joe          19.20918999794314
 and alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it          6.184651844049589
 theyre all barbers says he from the black country that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses          9.915086995907108
 and he was telling us theres two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull          4.192899597464994
 in the dark land they bide the vengeful knights of the razor          9.3131044509159

 so they started talking about capital punishment and of course bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time im told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about i dont know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on          3.66234865111403

 its only a natural phenomenon dont you see because on account of the          7.322937702169135
 and then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon          6.439834878513991
 the distinguished scientist herr professor luitpold blumenduft tendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would according to the best approved tradition of medical science be calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus thereby causing the elastic pores of the corpora cavernosa to rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection in articulo mortis per diminutionem capitis          4.290733503923662
 so of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged drawn and transported for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new ireland and new this that and the other          4.107121006840285

 mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching his scabs          26.294415218250673
 and round he goes to bob doran that was standing alf a half one sucking up for what he could get          6.300477003926391

 and one time he led him the rounds of dublin and by the holy farmer he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol and by herrings if the three women didnt near roast him its a queer story the old one blooms wife and mrs odowd that kept the hotel          4.396492794940301

 hard by the block stood the grim figure of the executioner his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered furiously          5.694003293240747

 and one or two sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females hitting below the belt          5.589394877911709

 and whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and in the third week after the feastday of the holy and undivided trinity the daughter of the skies the virgin moon being then in her first quarter it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the halls of law          4.59342367716815
 there master courtenay sitting in his own chamber gave his rede and master justice andrews sitting without a jury in the probate court weighed well and pondered the claim of the first chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and final testamentary disposition in re the real and personal estate of the late lamented jacob halliday vintner deceased versus livingstone an infant of unsound mind and another          5.155318385982893
 and to the solemn court of green street there came sir frederick the falconer          5.980896972627424
 and he sat him there about the hour of five oclock to administer the law of the brehons at the commission for all that and those parts to be holden in and for the county of the city of dublin          4.301587622349291
 and there sat with him the high sinhedrim of the twelve tribes of iar for every tribe one man of the tribe of patrick and of the tribe of hugh and of the tribe of owen and of the tribe of conn and of the tribe of oscar and of the tribe of fergus and of the tribe of finn and of the tribe of dermot and of the tribe of cormac and of the tribe of kevin and of the tribe of caolte and of the tribe of ossian there being in all twelve good men and true          1.7201339880891864

 and they rose in their seats those twelve of iar and they swore by the name of him who is from everlasting that they would do his rightwiseness          5.19703464455904
 and straightway the minions of the law led forth from their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended in consequence of information received          6.590316111770395
 and they shackled him hand and foot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge against him for he was a malefactor          6.817548353980467

 the observatory of dunsink registered in all eleven shocks all of the fifth grade of mercallis scale and there is no record extant of a similar seismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of the year of the rebellion of silken thomas          4.959894462415338

 all the lordly residences in the vicinity of the palace of justice were demolished and that noble edifice itself in which at the time of the catastrophe important legal debates were in progress is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it is to be feared all the occupants have been buried alive          4.188948406986326

 the summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious embrace          12.177246415303518
 far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand on the proud promontory of dear old howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay on the weedgrown rocks along sandymount shore and last but not least on the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man mary star of the sea          4.235133579739543
 the three girl friends were seated on the rocks enjoying the evening scene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly          6.864219803613383
 many a time and oft were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy chat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine cissy caffrey and edy boardman with the baby in the pushcar and tommy and jacky caffrey two little curlyheaded boys dressed in sailor suits with caps to match and the name h          4.559531065107739
 m          4941.9807692307695
 belleisle printed on both          749.1026924760995
 for tommy and jacky caffrey were twins scarce four years old and very noisy and spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with bright merry faces and endearing ways about them          5.1209751057155515
 they were dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets building castles as children do or playing with their big coloured ball happy as the day was long          7.115713702242828
 and edy boardman was rocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight          8.412400584602876
 he was but eleven months and nine days old and though still a tiny toddler was just beginning to lisp his first babyish words          5.735804108465546
 cissy caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin          12.084123253087578
 now baby cissy caffrey said          170.65704364582047
 say out big big          181.28917854436122
 i want a drink of water          28.410391079798615
 and baby prattled after her a jink a jink a jawbo          25.15386427969119
 cissy caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children so patient with little sufferers and tommy caffrey could never be got to take his castor oil unless it was cissy caffrey that held his nose and promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden syrup on          5.889098835621923
 what a persuasive power that girl had          43.71566161109723
 but to be sure baby boardman was as good as gold a perfect little dote in his new fancy bib          6.358705906525074
 none of your spoilt beauties flora macflimsy sort was cissy caffrey          14.08324111050762
 a truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life always with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe red lips a girl lovable in the extreme          7.349280710598113
 and edy boardman laughed too at the quaint language of little brother          16.46013373890501
 but just then there was a slight altercation between master tommy and master jacky          8.825486629699888
 boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to this golden rule          10.420082035263363
 the apple of discord was a certain castle of sand which master jacky had built and master tommy would have it right go wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the martello tower had          5.193512922441445
 but if master tommy was headstrong master jacky was selfwilled too and true to the maxim that every little irishmans house is his castle he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the wouldbe assailant came to grief and alas to relate          5.212205484566995
 the coveted castle too          586.2199395040581
 needless to say the cries of discomfited master tommy drew the attention of the girl friends          9.324632384842625
 come here tommy his sister called imperatively          49.36620026223314
 at once          590.837746895768
 and you jacky for shame to throw poor tommy in the dirty sand          11.01881598525926
 wait till i catch you for that          36.23016739584185
 his eyes misty with unshed tears master tommy came at her call for their big sisters word was law with the twins          8.72916600521168
 and in a sad plight he was too after his misadventure          7.220207275407147
 his little manowar top and unmentionables were full of sand but cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothing over lifes tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit          5.6783550121001465
 still the blue eyes were glistening with hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness and shook her hand at master jacky the culprit and said if she was near him she wouldnt be far from him her eyes dancing in admonition          5.200693711429766
 nasty bold jacky          14879.290765198348
 she cried          857.4142488198295
 she put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly whats your name          10.602129543336492
 butter and cream          975.9546209666735
 tell us who is your sweetheart spoke edy boardman          23.39956853625515
 is cissy your sweetheart          174.96088162895114
 nao tearful tommy said          4106.254796778857
 is edy boardman your sweetheart          174.633737776692
 cissy queried          9148.216088525864
 nao tommy said          4636.071897480359
 i know edy boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from her shortsighted eyes          11.084909397373108
 gerty is tommys sweetheart          953.0627434120295
 nao tommy said on the verge of tears          54.07767908660258
 cissys quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to edy boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman couldnt see and to mind he didnt wet his new tan shoes          8.218802666881395
 but who was gerty          85.33784621304984
 gerty macdowell who was seated near her companions lost in thought gazing far away into the distance was in very truth as fair a specimen of winsome irish girlhood as one could wish to see          6.822414212136356
 she was pronounced beautiful by all who knew her though as folks often said she was more a giltrap than a macdowell          8.748203735077084
 her figure was slight and graceful inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking of late had done her a world of good much better than the widow welchs female pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to get and that tired feeling          4.865279156660626
 the waxen pallor of her face was almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine cupids bow greekly perfect          9.157506882997643
 her hands were of finely veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath either          5.358508186694733
 bertha supple told that once to edy boardman a deliberate lie when she was black out at daggers drawn with gerty the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals and she told her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or shed never speak to her again          5.2440287804365004
 honour where honour is due          218.24948926339042
 there was an innate refinement a languid queenly hauteur about gerty which was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep          6.913595753096032
 had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education gerty macdowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to her          5.095972530529704
 mayhap it was this the love that might have been that lent to her softlyfeatured face at whiles a look tense with suppressed meaning that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes a charm few could resist          5.385685464190422
 why have women such eyes of witchery          42.68717757718271
 gertys were of the bluest irish blue set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive brows          9.957431852949316
 it was madame vera verity directress of the woman beautiful page of the princess novelette who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes so becoming in leaders of fashion and she had never regretted it          5.534926765697721
 then there was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase your height and you have a beautiful face but your nose          6.23096687016695
 that would suit mrs dignam because she had a button one          13.686362750236519
 but gertys crowning glory was her wealth of wonderful hair          39.19907213660748
 it was dark brown with a natural wave in it          14.424686659073403
 she had cut it that very morning on account of the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of luxuriant clusters and pared her nails too thursday for wealth          5.373307732725952
 for an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes          15.977020778391127
 she was about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue          9.682062950611106
 inclination prompted her to speak out dignity told her to be silent          28.179407025230326
 the pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young may morning          6.272700323873642
 she knew right well noone better what made squinty edy say that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a lovers quarrel          6.828572425141576
 as per usual somebodys nose was out of joint about the boy that had the bicycle off the london bridge road always riding up and down in front of her window          5.3727429366404715
 only now his father kept him in in the evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on and he was going to go to trinity college to study for a doctor when he left the high school like his brother w          4.551659645873665
 wylie who was racing in the bicycle races in trinity college university          15.262092010850898
 little recked he perhaps for what she felt that dull aching void in her heart sometimes piercing to the core          9.926348377734865
 yet he was young and perchance he might learn to love her in time          9.535893441089945
 they were protestants in his family and of course gerty knew who came first and after him the blessed virgin and then saint joseph          7.994844804544538
 but he was undeniably handsome with an exquisite nose and he was what he looked every inch a gentleman the shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would know anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size too he and she and that was why edy boardman thought she was so frightfully clever because he didnt go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden          3.8102159295610396
 gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of dame fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be out          6.1891615889142155
 a neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes because it was expected in the ladys pictorial that electric blue would be worn with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit and a navy threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure to perfection          4.9422842640942255
 she wore a coquettish little love of a hat of wideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue chenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone          5.87047084725538
 all tuesday week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she found what she wanted at clerys summer sales the very it slightly shopsoiled but you would never notice seven fingers two and a penny          6.463342253328619
 she did it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on then smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her          5.8172371225672
 and when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that that would take the shine out of some people she knew          5.760591460567791
 her shoes were the newest thing in footwear edy boardman prided herself that she was very petite but she never had a foot like gerty macdowell a five and never would ash oak or elm with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle over her higharched instep          5.399289964761565
 as for undies they were gertys chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen though gerty would never see seventeen again can find it in his heart to blame her          6.226699031483688
 she had four dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery three garments and nighties extra and each set slotted with different coloured ribbons rosepink pale blue mauve and peagreen and she aired them herself and blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldnt trust those washerwomen as far as shed see them scorching the things          4.454649872787357
 she was wearing the blue for luck hoping against hope her own colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that was for luck and lovers meeting if you put those things on inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long as it wasnt of a friday          4.238823225974797
 and yet and yet          48.03792477045671
 that strained look on her face          81.24372767076169
 a gnawing sorrow is there all the time          34.64658074315367
 her very soul is in her eyes and she would give worlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where giving way to tears she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelings though not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the mirror          4.97235337012887
 you are lovely gerty it said          45.85886860440914
 gerty macdowell yearns in vain          593.0303191514856
 yes she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for mrs reggy wylie t          6.06569114281918
 d          3724.391304347826
 because the one who married the elder brother would be mrs wylie and in the fashionable intelligence mrs gertrude wylie was wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not to be          5.363690407958177
 he was too young to understand          24.82309122441062
 he would not believe in love a womans birthright          14.823124699142825
 the night of the party long ago in stoers he was still in short trousers when they were alone and he stole an arm round her waist she went white to the very lips          4.652423314344373
 he called her little one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss the first          7.825891758902626
 but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from the room with a remark about refreshments          5.61659269839824
 impetuous fellow          13615.608771165322
 strength of character had never been reggy wylies strong point and he who would woo and win gerty macdowell must be a man among men          7.7030432938271645
 but waiting always waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be over          8.75441905014512
 no prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous love at her feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who had not found his ideal perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey and who would understand take her in his sheltering arms strain her to him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort her with a long long kiss          5.112636728464782
 it would be like heaven          38.201039471440104
 for such a one she yearns this balmy summer eve          12.41472107949572
 with all the heart of her she longs to be his only his affianced bride for riches for poor in sickness in health till death us two part from this to this day forward          5.0052609022714805
 and while edy boardman was with little tommy behind the pushcar she was just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his little wife to be          6.374037487225141
 then they could talk about her till they went blue in the face bertha supple too and edy little spitfire because she would be twentytwo in november          6.489869086274909
 she would care for him with creature comforts too for gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that feeling of hominess          7.3081998668357135
 her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and queen anns pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire dredge in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though she didnt like the eating part when there were any people that made her shy and often she wondered why you couldnt eat something poetical like violets or roses and they would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom with pictures and engravings and the photograph of grandpapa giltraps lovely dog garryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in clerys summer jumble sales like they have in rich houses          4.300523182817124
 he would be tall with broad shoulders she had always admired tall men for a husband with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their honeymoon three wonderful weeks          5.339328421370951
 and then when they settled down in a nice snug and cosy little homely house every morning they would both have brekky simple but perfectly served for their own two selves and before he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes          4.688554934517156
 edy boardman asked tommy caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off and play with jacky and to be good now and not to fight          6.5371785163061205
 but tommy said he wanted the ball and edy told him no that baby was playing with the ball and if he took it thered be wigs on the green but tommy said it was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground if you please          4.7652036662912804
 the temper of him          75.94733056527414
 o he was a man already was little tommy caffrey since he was out of pinnies          6.354433153020948
 edy told him no no and to be off now with him and she told cissy caffrey not to give in to him          7.48130645552403
 youre not my sister naughty tommy said          33.57279357283448
 its my ball          794.1879639062513
 but cissy caffrey told baby boardman to look up look up high at her finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and tommy after it in full career having won the day          6.3132888479925295
 anything for a quiet life laughed ciss          21.299799432766395
 and she tickled tiny tots two cheeks to make him forget and played heres the lord mayor heres his two horses heres his gingerbread carriage and here he walks in chinchopper chinchopper chinchopper chin          6.005253703385828
 but edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way like that from everyone always petting him          9.001459835343084
 id like to give him something she said so i would where i wont say          9.83838701095822
 on the beeoteetom laughed cissy merrily          69.18973522512407
 gerty macdowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of cissy saying an unladylike thing like that out loud shed be ashamed of her life to say flushing a deep rosy red and edy boardman said she was sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said          6.135995274214313
 but not a pin cared ciss          24.893672049517946
 let him          541.8767060949393
 she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of her nose          7.606585004564492
 give it to him too on the same place as quick as id look at him          8.16571037163709
 madcap ciss with her golliwog curls          154.9968001038404
 you had to laugh at her sometimes          11.933142433673561
 for instance when she asked you would you have some more chinese tea and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the mens faces on her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the miss white          4.803916031898276
 that was just like cissycums          47.3601144480234
 there was none to come up to her for fun          7.450079592800718
 but she was sincerity itself one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made not one of your twofaced things too sweet to be wholesome          5.760066644897839
 and then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the pealing anthem of the organ          6.625206480768568
 it was the mens temperance retreat conducted by the missioner the reverend john hughes s          5.070190756048368
 rosary sermon and benediction of the most blessed sacrament          28.496453021852773
 they were there gathered together without distinction of social class and a most edifying spectacle it was to see in that simple fane beside the waves after the storms of this weary world kneeling before the feet of the immaculate reciting the litany of our lady of loreto beseeching her to intercede for them the old familiar words holy mary holy virgin of virgins          4.341971735122276
 how sad to poor gertys ears          45.117065580081665
 had her father only avoided the clutches of the demon drink by taking the pledge or those powders the drink habit cured in pearsons weekly she might now be rolling in her carriage second to none          5.481606060022201
 over and over had she told herself that as she mused by the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp because she hated two lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket thinking          4.614738574014689
 but that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cast its shadow over her childhood days          8.979973020061554
 nay she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father a prey to the fumes of intoxication forget himself completely for if there was one thing of all things that gerty knew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of kindness deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low          4.451767238658948
 and still the voices sang in supplication to the virgin most powerful virgin most merciful          7.0000300994798135
 and gerty rapt in thought scarce saw or heard her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off sandymount green that cissy caffrey called the man that was so like himself passing along the strand taking a short walk          5.533407829766785
 you never saw him any way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a father because he was too old or something or on account of his face it was a palpable case of doctor fell or his carbuncly nose with the pimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose          4.712364192937786
 poor father          1110.4233391124608
 with all his faults she loved him still when he sang tell me mary how to woo thee or my love and cottage near rochelle and they had stewed cockles and lettuce with lazenbys salad dressing for supper and when he sang the moon hath raised with mr dignam that died suddenly and was buried god have mercy on him from a stroke          4.383526748282904
 her mothers birthday that was and charley was home on his holidays and tom and mr dignam and mrs and patsy and freddy dignam and they were to have had a group taken          6.790206307134189
 noone would have thought the end was so near          25.07770642231183
 now he was laid to rest          24.786054192517053
 and her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldnt even go to the funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples from his office about catesbys cork lino artistic standard designs fit for a palace gives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the home          4.008559201981171
 a sterling good daughter was gerty just like a second mother in the house a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in gold          6.867187821125081
 and when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was it rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but gerty though she didnt like her mothers taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single thing they ever had words about taking snuff          4.072804395146642
 everyone thought the world of her for her gentle ways          17.923871984581524
 it was gerty who turned off the gas at the main every night and it was gerty who tacked up on the wall of that place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime mr tunney the grocers christmas almanac the picture of halcyon days where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with oldtime chivalry through her lattice window          4.1844485822594075
 you could see there was a story behind it          15.969819980196313
 the colours were done something lovely          36.03932464782334
 she was in a soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat          5.823704203838052
 she often looked at them dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and thought about those times because she had found out in walkers pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa giltrap about the halcyon days what they meant          5.198504834501462
 the twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till at last master jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could down towards the seaweedy rocks          4.915771006883678
 needless to say poor tommy was not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted the ball          6.473394142442945
 our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and to avoid trouble cissy caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to her please          8.377711262606798
 the gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw it up the strand towards cissy caffrey but it rolled down the slope and stopped right under gertys skirt near the little pool by the rock          6.427305285624156
 the twins clamoured again for it and cissy told her to kick it away and let them fight for it so gerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball hadnt come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and edy and cissy laughed          5.594961981502704
 if you fail try again edy boardman said          37.44406943620699
 gerty smiled assent and bit her lip          102.82626003951026
 a delicate pink crept into her pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towards the shingle          5.3194289015966625
 pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking          7.193645968594502
 she felt the warm flush a danger signal always with gerty macdowell surging and flaming into her cheeks          7.755488800429142
 till then they had only exchanged glances of the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she ventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the twilight wan and strangely drawn seemed to her the saddest she had ever seen          5.10285483459775
 through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of original sin spiritual vessel pray for us honourable vessel pray for us vessel of singular devotion pray for us mystical rose          4.782875633149379
 and careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erred and wandered their eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright with hope for the reverend father father hughes had told them what the great saint bernard said in his famous prayer of mary the most pious virgins intercessory power that it was not recorded in any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by her          4.749082986710121
 the twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of childhood are but as fleeting summer showers          6.649941786396777
 cissy caffrey played with baby boardman till he crowed with glee clapping baby hands in air          15.480562189912483
 peep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and edy asked where was cissy gone and then cissy popped up her head and cried ah          7.945934768792391
 and my word didnt the little chap enjoy that          15.434789299013305
 and then she told him to say papa          14.917320082605183
 say papa baby          4377.294211652379
 say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa          15.048396038290468
 and baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of health a perfect little bunch of love and he would certainly turn out to be something great they said          4.705840816852814
 haja ja ja haja          6594.738678367632
 cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to sit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried out holy saint denis that he was possing wet and to double the half blanket the other way under him          5.333118914421696
 of course his infant majesty was most obstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa          6.852255404967737
 and two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks          12.885460198184049
 it was all no use soothering him with no nono baby no and telling him about the geegee and where was the puffpuff but ciss always readywitted gave him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was quickly appeased          4.858126909110864
 gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out of that and not get on her nerves no hour to be out and the little brats of twins          6.426002692033726
 she gazed out towards the distant sea          34.82228806445777
 it was like the paintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out the evening and the clouds coming out and the bailey light on howth and to hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they burned in the church like a kind of waft          4.27347151211058
 and while she gazed her heart went pitapat          16.940935581140316
 yes it was her he was looking at and there was meaning in his look          7.576427853870189
 his eyes burned into her as though they would search her through and through read her very soul          9.779929559490512
 wonderful eyes they were superbly expressive but could you trust them          17.954665856912392
 people were so queer          179.13709157533228
 she could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face that he was a foreigner the image of the photo she had of martin harvey the matinee idol only for the moustache which she preferred because she wasnt stagestruck like winny rippingham that wanted they two to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not see whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly retroussé from where he was sitting          4.213643954492593
 he was in deep mourning she could see that and the story of a haunting sorrow was written on his face          5.825854623722022
 she would have given worlds to know what it was          15.230095865214405
 he was looking up so intently so still and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down          5.342769895592776
 she was glad that something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking reggy wylie might be out but that was far away          7.015485903260015
 here was that of which she had so often dreamed          12.644970882098498
 it was he who mattered and there was joy on her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he was like noone else          5.733860286469933
 the very heart of the girlwoman went out to him her dreamhusband because she knew on the instant it was him          7.126425320369491
 if he had suffered more sinned against than sinning or even even if he had been himself a sinner a wicked man she cared not          5.645136709795039
 even if he was a protestant or methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved her          8.306482591801736
 there were wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm          38.42592919085253
 she was a womanly woman not like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known those cyclists showing off what they hadnt got and she just yearned to know all to forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her make him forget the memory of the past          4.398920434756325
 then mayhap he would embrace her gently like a real man crushing her soft body to him and love her his ownest girlie for herself alone          7.462668120745297
 refuge of sinners          4903.106239161532
 comfortress of the afflicted          127.79156860324711
 ora pro nobis          53648.11438851726
 well has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can never be lost or cast away and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heart          5.270371210573737
 gerty could picture the whole scene in the church the stained glass windows lighted up the candles the flowers and the blue banners of the blessed virgins sodality and father conroy was helping canon ohanlon at the altar carrying things in and out with his eyes cast down          5.713091305255307
 he looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever she became a dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come to the convent for the novena of saint dominic          5.337677913278073
 he told her that time when she told him about that in confession crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he could see not to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we were all subject to natures laws he said in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by god he said and that our blessed lady herself said to the archangel gabriel be it done unto me according to thy word          4.332624178563814
 he was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little house to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hours adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of dublin or some place          3.8975760128169052
 the exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and jacky threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it          7.2552853197919
 little monkeys common as ditchwater          286.12891996453465
 someone ought to take them and give them a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places the both of them          7.244735931841623
 and cissy and edy shouted after them to come back because they were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned          6.078610479547644
 jacky          12237.285714285714
 tommy          7138.416666666666
 not they          271.99868983649736
 what a great notion they had          34.00008923272114
 so cissy said it was the very last time shed ever bring them out          11.780551532275608
 she jumped up and called them and she ran down the slope past him tossing her hair behind her which had a good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldnt get it to grow long because it wasnt natural so she could just go and throw her hat at it          4.987171243700912
 she ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didnt rip up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboy about cissy caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show off and just because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible          3.9778522627125703
 it would have served her just right if she had tripped up over something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked french heels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumble          5.439303667831603
 tableau          128491.49999999999
 that would have been a very charming exposé for a gentleman like that to witness          9.066349090473018
 three and eleven she paid for those stockings in sparrows of georges street on the tuesday no the monday before easter and there wasnt a brack on them and that was what he was looking at transparent and not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape nor form the cheek of her          4.841569026414314
 because he had eyes in his head to see the difference for himself          10.44912078860024
 cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a streel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat hanging like a caricature          4.8648300929911725
 gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle her hair and a prettier a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was never seen on a girls shouldersa radiant little vision in sooth almost maddening in its sweetness          4.642316018838407
 you would have to travel many a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that          6.602463926655357
 she could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerve          8.875084318918061
 she put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes          5.484878644584506
 he was eying her as a snake eyes its prey          19.46320066713435
 her womans instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose          6.559906989898445
 edy boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at gerty half smiling with her specs like an old maid pretending to nurse the baby          8.138846315764468
 irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why noone could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of hers          8.899950275302812
 and she said to gerty a penny for your thoughts          10.986660141955547
 replied gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth          18.573434592335463
 i was only wondering was it late          22.67810751806992
 because she wished to goodness theyd take the snottynosed twins and their babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave a gentle hint about its being late          6.630351092170072
 and when cissy came up edy asked her the time and miss cissy as glib as you like said it was half past kissing time time to kiss again          6.207145860372882
 but edy wanted to know because they were told to be in early          16.072482477023804
 wait said cissy ill run ask my uncle peter over there whats the time by his conundrum          9.992351021040648
 so over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his hand out of his pocket getting nervous and beginning to play with his watchchain looking up at the church          5.104161366632067
 passionate nature though he was gerty could see that he had enormous control over himself          15.845146038322312
 one moment he had been there fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze and the next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman selfcontrol expressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure          5.8836577439322095
 cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the right time and gerty could see him taking out his watch listening to it and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sun was set          4.477016925196535
 his voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones          6.17210183749926
 cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said his waterworks were out of order          9.679915690568281
 then they sang the second verse of the tantum ergo and canon ohanlon got up again and censed the blessed sacrament and knelt down and he told father conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the flowers and father conroy got up and settled it all right and she could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and she swung her leg more in and out in time          4.330850339340342
 it was getting darker but he could see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands back into his pockets          4.9271872531208
 she felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on because the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of the moon          4.2363270346981174
 his dark eyes fixed themselves on her again drinking in her every contour literally worshipping at her shrine          7.817900543724392
 if ever there was undisguised admiration in a mans passionate gaze it was there plain to be seen on that mans face          5.993922832292516
 it is for you gertrude macdowell and you know it          10.771989487262138
 edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and gerty noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place to push up the pushcar and cissy took off the twins caps and tidied their hair to make herself attractive of course and canon ohanlon stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and father conroy handed him the card to read off and he read out panem de coelo praestitisti eis and edy and cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing politeness when edy asked her was she heartbroken about her best boy throwing her over          3.838433859794123
 a brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn immeasurable          12.88511376821534
 it hurto yes it cut deep because edy had her own quiet way of saying things like that she knew would wound like the confounded little cat she was          7.725923299285256
 gertys lips parted swiftly to frame the word but she fought back the sob that rose to her throat so slim so flawless so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of          7.680007917126427
 she had loved him better than he knew          28.312773205106513
 lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears          7.414087687331977
 their eyes were probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see          6.117332003002687
 o responded gerty quick as lightning laughing and the proud head flashed up          18.561657274478982
 i can throw my cap at who i like because its leap year          14.07909707590311
 her words rang out crystalclear more musical than the cooing of the ringdove but they cut the silence icily          9.691869653802438
 there was that in her young voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with          6.011154036316903
 as for mr reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a dozen pieces          4.578709202425158
 and if ever after he dared to presume she could give him one look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot          6.237383350441953
 miss puny little edys countenance fell to no slight extent and gerty could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering rage though she hid it the little kinnatt because that shaft had struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was something aloof apart in another sphere that she was not of them and never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it          4.710631177447303
 edy straightened up baby boardman to get ready to go and cissy tucked in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the sandman was on his way for master boardman junior          5.296441129846785
 and cissy told him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby looked just too ducky laughing up out of his gleeful eyes and cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby without as much as by your leave sent up his compliments to all and sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib          4.816774218668613
 puddeny pie          65453.77300453338
 protested ciss          52503.07125104321
 he has his bib destroyed          34.3467350320498
 the slight contretemps claimed her attention but in two twos she set that little matter to rights          12.220407638118871
 gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and edy asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed it off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet seashore because canon ohanlon was up on the altar with the veil that father conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the blessed sacrament in his hands          4.482529165031369
 and she could see far away the lights of the lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of paints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along by shady tritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the lamp near her window where reggy wylie used to turn his freewheel like she read in that book the lamplighter by miss cummins author of mabel vaughan and other tales          4.20729540811532
 for gerty had her dreams that noone knew of          19.07576345101649
 she loved to read poetry and when she got a keepsake from bertha supple of that lovely confession album with the coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of her toilettable which though it did not err on the side of luxury was scrupulously neat and clean          4.737222012608471
 it was there she kept her girlish treasure trove the tortoiseshell combs her child of mary badge the whiterose scent the eyebrowleine her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change when her things came home from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in helys of dame street for she felt that she too could write poetry if she could only express herself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the potherbs          4.037322499182623
 art thou real my ideal          260.0339083050961
 it was called by louis j walsh magherafelt and after there was something about twilight wilt thou ever          7.4838970079022955
 and ofttimes the beauty of poetry so sad in its transient loveliness had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the years were slipping by for her one by one and but for that one shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an accident coming down dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it          4.616577801709848
 but it must end she felt          39.20353592410457
 if she saw that magic lure in his eyes there would be no holding back for her          9.444550202643656
 love laughs at locksmiths          254.00516154347153
 she would make the great sacrifice          44.77310274737004
 her every effort would be to share his thoughts          26.556186076930487
 dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his days with happiness          10.764348230413125
 there was the allimportant question and she was dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land of song had to have her put into a madhouse cruel only to be kind          4.495230526933868
 but even ifwhat then          843.6780628495234
 would it make a very great difference          30.164482194557717
 from everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively recoiled          12.617258314297008
 no no not that          104.07108273461127
 they would be just good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other in spite of the conventions of society with a big ess          6.301173770688714
 perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall          8.007184871428231
 she thought she understood          137.8371817718037
 she would try to understand him because men were so different          16.60546323626859
 the old love was waiting waiting with little white hands stretched out with blue appealing eyes          8.333652953001549
 heart of mine          540.357928651691
 she would follow her dream of love the dictates of her heart that told her he was her all in all the only man in all the world for her for love was the master guide          5.7829433845541
 nothing else mattered          9196.65030762142
 come what might she would be wild untrammelled free          22.61284525934352
 canon ohanlon put the blessed sacrament back into the tabernacle and genuflected and the choir sang laudate dominum omnes gentes and then he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and father conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat edy asked wasnt she coming but jacky caffrey called out o look cissy          5.5534190120113
 and they all looked was it sheet lightning but tommy saw it too over the trees beside the church blue and then green and purple          5.729760840655194
 its fireworks cissy caffrey said          214.73251536785335
 and they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church helterskelter edy with the pushcar with baby boardman in it and cissy holding tommy and jacky by the hand so they wouldnt fall running          4.910166560557852
 come on gerty cissy called          87.07443310194914
 its the bazaar fireworks          164.1886563606186
 but gerty was adamant          147.18871741495474
 she had no intention of being at their beck and call          12.695603422787476
 if they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could see from where she was          7.692178854409109
 the eyes that were fastened upon her set her pulses tingling          9.540732053190757
 whitehot passion was in that face passion silent as the grave and it had made her his          13.355172881499838
 at last they were left alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he could be trusted to the death steadfast a sterling man a man of inflexible honour to his fingertips          5.602220277156681
 his hands and face were working and a tremour went over her          9.284077526456207
 she leaned back far to look up where the fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back looking up and there was noone to see only him and her when she revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that supply soft and delicately rounded and she seemed to hear the panting of his heart his hoarse breathing because she knew too about the passion of men like that hotblooded because bertha supple told her once in dead secret and made her swear shed never about the gentleman lodger that was staying with them out of the congested districts board that had pictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes in the bed          4.211088625080939
 but this was altogether different from a thing like that because there was all the difference because she could almost feel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his handsome lips          4.91123512782375
 besides there was absolution so long as you didnt do the other thing before being married and there ought to be women priests that would understand without your telling out and cissy caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes so that she too my dear and winny rippingham so mad about actors photographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on the way it did          4.338140716367391
 and jacky caffrey shouted to look there was another and she leaned back and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and they all saw it and they all shouted to look look there it was and she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was flying through the air a soft thing to and fro dark          4.492072969916548
 she would fain have cried to him chokingly held out her snowy slender arms to him to come to feel his lips laid on her white brow the cry of a young girls love a little strangled cry wrung from her that cry that has rung through the ages          5.676744113248009
 and then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and o          8.103434907412732
 then the roman candle burst and it was like a sigh of o          11.141848160482075
 and everyone cried o          216.28190304341817
 in raptures and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah          8.26362664935228
 they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden o so lovely o soft sweet soft          8.546620491640585
 she glanced at him as she bent forward quickly a pathetic little glance of piteous protest of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl          7.04494165739445
 he was leaning back against the rock behind          24.418814879485637
 leopold bloom for it is he stands silent with bowed head before those young guileless eyes          9.52140133157155
 at it again          257.4358751103087
 an utter cad he had been          242.41541569205182
 he of all men          32.234299665749674
 but there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned and wandered          6.030191150272912
 should a girl tell          182.08159474366704
 no a thousand times no          69.40829050005959
 that was their secret only theirs alone in the hiding twilight and there was none to know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the evening to and fro and little bats dont tell          4.79338355137224
 cissy caffrey whistled imitating the boys in the football field to show what a great person she was and then she cried gerty          11.256325897873642
 gerty          4672.418181818181
 were going          726.3998487841011
 come on          309.1680993227285
 we can see from farther up          56.958307379967
 gerty had an idea one of loves little ruses          21.776273057367813

 universally that persons acumen is esteemed very little perceptive concerning whatsoever matters are being held as most profitably by mortals with sapience endowed to be studied who is ignorant of that which the most in doctrine erudite and certainly by reason of that in them high minds ornament deserving of veneration constantly maintain when by general consent they affirm that other circumstances being equal by no exterior splendour is the prosperity of a nation more efficaciously asserted than by the measure of how far forward may have progressed the tribute of its solicitude for that proliferent continuance which of evils the original if it be absent when fortunately present constitutes the certain sign of omnipollent natures incorrupted benefaction          4.6409502813996815
 for who is there who anything of some significance has apprehended but is conscious that that exterior splendour may be the surface of a downwardtending lutulent reality or on the contrary anyone so is there unilluminated as not to perceive that as no natures boon can contend against the bounty of increase so it behoves every most just citizen to become the exhortator and admonisher of his semblables and to tremble lest what had in the past been by the nation excellently commenced might be in the future not with similar excellence accomplished if an inverecund habit shall have gradually traduced the honourable by ancestors transmitted customs to that thither of profundity that that one was audacious excessively who would have the hardihood to rise affirming that no more odious offence can for anyone be than to oblivious neglect to consign that evangel simultaneously command and promise which on all mortals with prophecy of abundance or with diminutions menace that exalted of reiteratedly procreating function ever irrevocably enjoined          4.130015074388383

 the man that was come in to the house then spoke to the nursingwoman and he asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in childbed          4.818835481275081
 the nursingwoman answered him and said that that woman was in throes now full three days and that it would be a hard birth unneth to bear but that now in a little it would be          5.671855282877762
 she said thereto that she had seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was that womans birth          8.625264762984306
 then she set it all forth to him for because she knew the man that time was had lived nigh that house          7.661969501951351
 the man hearkened to her words for he felt with wonder womens woe in the travail that they have of motherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair face for any man to see but yet was she left after long years a handmaid          5.391251550167007

 and whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there nighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat          5.545271029474487
 and there came against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept dixon          9.1563451851078
 and he said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with them that were there          5.582192303604916
 and the traveller leopold said that he should go otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile          4.951401304286964
 also the lady was of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility          6.52762391863604
 but the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a marvellous castle          6.6204526071469205
 and the traveller leopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometime venery          5.305340586306066
 and in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of finlandy and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not move more for enchantment          4.588399083134637
 and on this board were frightful swords and knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there abound marvellously          5.012571652151181
 and there were vessels that are wrought by magic of mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that he blases in to them like to bubbles          5.380612051729772
 and full fair cheer and rich was on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer          8.298687038181015
 and there was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be possible thing without they see it natheless they are so          4.65925089420351
 and these fishes lie in an oily water brought there from portugal land because of the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress          7.002816608785209
 and also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of chaldee that by aid of certain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountain          4.752048244956063
 and they teach the serpents there to entwine themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead          5.717492603495793
 and the learning knight let pour for childe leopold a draught and halp thereto the while all they that were there drank every each          6.618802183103528
 and childe leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and his neighbour nist not of this wile          5.514544594708448
 and he sat down in that castle with them for to rest him there awhile          7.833819931691621
 thanked be almighty god          1060.9575213883747
 this meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at the reverence of jesu our alther liege lord to leave their wassailing for there was above one quick with child a gentle dame whose time hied fast          6.054166561389822
 sir leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what cry that it was whether of child or woman and i marvel said he that it be not come or now          6.5485730288742765
 meseems it dureth overlong          2254.803125138513
 and he was ware and saw a franklin that hight lenehan on that side the table that was older than any of the tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full gently          4.387238928105976
 but said he or it be long too she will bring forth by god his bounty and have joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long          5.894952493235539
 and the franklin that had drunken said expecting each moment to be her next          8.808075973032942
 also he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him to drink and now drink said he fully delectably and he quaffed as far as he might to their boths health for he was a passing good man of his lustiness          4.954306535033879
 and sir leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat in scholars hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very truest knight of the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged him courtly in the cup          4.376867178463796
 womans woe with wonder pondering          146.92888874964342
 now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be drunken an they might          8.854014131208993
 there was a sort of scholars along either side the board that is to wit dixon yclept junior of saint mary merciables with other his fellows lynch and madden scholars of medicine and the franklin that hight lenehan and one from alba longa one crotthers and young stephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board and costello that men clepen punch costello all long of a mastery of him erewhile gested and of all them reserved young stephen he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead and beside the meek sir leopold          3.9693532695226392
 but on young malachi they waited for that he promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke his avow          6.333981826177416
 and sir leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir simon and to this his son young stephen and for that his languor becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feasted him for that time in the honourablest manner          5.317372545812713
 for they were right witty scholars          29.547059170918796
 and he heard their aresouns each gen other as touching birth and righteousness young madden maintaining that put such case it were hard the wife to die for so it had fallen out a matter of some year agone with a woman of eblana in hornes house that now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case          4.40906419553428
 and they said farther she should live because in the beginning they said the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of this imagination affirmed how young madden had said truth for he had conscience to let her die          4.924204418546309
 and not few and of these was young lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges did provide no remedy          5.270667589061836
 a redress god grant          419.6315427866788
 this was scant said but all cried with one acclaim nay by our virgin mother the wife should live and the babe to die          8.189416688100494
 in colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but the franklin lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lack          6.408710661368836
 then young madden showed all the whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to saint ultan of arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby they were all wondrous grieved          5.4182495358821265
 to whom young stephen had these words following murmur sirs is eke oft among lay folk          10.079494979794204
 both babe and parent now glorify their maker the one in limbo gloom the other in purgefire          10.019352291600036
 but gramercy what of those godpossibled souls that we nightly impossibilise which is the sin against the holy ghost very god lord and giver of life          7.796511917838796
 we are means to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends than we          11.144080073441726
 then said dixon junior to punch costello wist he what ends          17.68595504822737
 but he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead          5.026184007524983
 whereat crotthers of alba longa sang young malachis praise of that beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn the other all this while pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice him witnessing all and several by saint foutinus his engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to do          5.124437638735688
 thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young stephen and sir leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might be or wheresoever          6.173974015878426
 then spake young stephen orgulous of mother church that would cast him out of her bosom of law of canons of lilith patron of abortions of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or as virgilius saith by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with effectu secuto or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of averroes and moses maimonides          4.568772437779351
 he said also how at the end of the second month a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for gods greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the fishermans seal even that blessed peter on which rock was holy church for all ages founded          4.343340921867268
 all they bachelors then asked of sir leopold would he in like case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life          7.788894035951353
 a wariness of mind he would answer as fitted all and laying hand to jaw he said dissembling as his wont was that as it was informed him who had ever loved the art of physic as might a layman and agreeing also with his experience of so seldomseen an accident it was good for that mother church belike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their questions          4.698768082791988
 that is truth pardy said dixon and or i err a pregnant word          11.6269843130873
 which hearing young stephen was a marvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that taking it appeared eftsoons          4.2942693906808485
 but sir leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and as he was minded of his good lady marion that had borne him an only manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art could save so dark is destiny          4.890449224557312
 and she was wondrous stricken of heart for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of lambs wool the flower of the flock lest he might perish utterly and lie akeled for it was then about the midst of the winter and now sir leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his friends son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage for all accounted him of real parts so grieved he also in no less measure for young stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and murdered his goods with whores          4.142726764646634
 about that present time young stephen filled all cups that stood empty so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed their approach from him that still plied it very busily who praying for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff he gave them for a pledge the vicar of christ which also as he said is vicar of bray          4.865335066641153

 and he showed them glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the worth of two pound nineteen shilling that he had he said for a song which he writ          5.542128769687089
 they all admired to see the foresaid riches in such dearth of money as was herebefore          10.258043587556088
 his words were then these as followeth know all men he said times ruins build eternitys mansions          8.662209461660517

 in hornes house rest should reign          72.46880410722395
 to be short this passage was scarce by when master dixon of mary in eccles goodly grinning asked young stephen what was the reason why he had not cided to take friars vows and he answered him obedience in the womb chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days          4.803460336522265
 master lenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds and how as he heard hereof counted he had besmirched the lily virtue of a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all intershowed it too waxing merry and toasting to his fathership          5.137570384491015
 but he said very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was the eternal son and ever virgin          6.751390657373382
 thereat mirth grew in them the more and they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing and deflowering of spouses as the priests use in madagascar island she to be in guise of white and saffron her groom in white and grain with burning of nard and tapers on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries and the anthem ut novetur sexus omnis corporis mysterium till she was there unmaided          5.466288407214504

 and master lynch bade him have a care to flout and witwanton as the god self was angered for his hellprate and paganry          7.482993046695524
 and he that had erst challenged to be so doughty waxed wan as they might all mark and shrank together and his pitch that was before so haught uplift was now of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart shook within the cage of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that storm          4.442200315963133
 then did some mock and some jeer and punch costello fell hard again to his yale which master lenehan vowed he would do after and he was indeed but a word and a blow on any the least colour          5.576692400500601

 for through that tube he saw that he was in the land of phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die as he was like the rest too a passing show          4.578680217298893
 and would he not accept to die like the rest and pass away          8.264874734698369

 yes pious had told him of that land and chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing exterior whose name she said is birdinthehand and she beguiled him wrongways from the true path by her flatteries that she said to him as ho you pretty man turn aside hither and i will show you a brave place and she lay at him so flatteringly that she had him in her grot which is named twointhebush or by some learned carnal concupiscence          4.606484726718057
 this was it what all that company that sat there at commons in manse of mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore birdinthehand which was within all foul plagues monsters and a wicked devil they would strain the last but they would make at her and know her          4.628408940570376
 for regarding believeonme they said it was nought else but notion and they could conceive no thought of it for first twointhebush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and in it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these words printed on them pickaback and topsyturvy and shameface and cheek by jowl and second for that foul plague allpox and the monsters they cared not for them for preservative had given them a stout shield of oxengut and third that they might take no hurt neither from offspring that was that wicked devil by virtue of this same shield which was named killchild          4.686053945428077

 from a child this frank had been a donought that his father a headborough who could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and the use of the globes matriculated at the university to study the mechanics but he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his volumes          4.542048068725875
 one time he would be a playactor then a sutler or a welsher then nought would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main then he was for the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the romany folk kidnapping a squires heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids linen or choking chicken behind a hedge          4.709643931698384

 mr stephen a little moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he had dispatches from the emperors chief tailtickler thanking him for the hospitality that was sending over doctor rinderpest the bestquoted cowcatcher in all muscovy with a bolus or two of physic to take the bull by the horns          4.3652112119689335

 hell find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull thats irish says he          10.006077022147975
 irish by name and irish by nature says mr stephen and he sent the ale purling about an irish bull in an english chinashop          6.756284441279247
 i conceive you says mr dixon          55.026073132406054
 it is that same bull that was sent to our island by farmer nicholas the bravest cattlebreeder of them all with an emerald ring in his nose          5.28493089334165
 true for you says mr vincent cross the table and a bullseye into the bargain says he and a plumper and a portlier bull says he never shit on shamrock          5.429620467341881
 he had horns galore a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils so that the women of our island leaving doughballs and rollingpins followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains          5.176672438222431
 so be off now says he and do all my cousin german the lord harry tells you and take a farmers blessing and with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly          5.734782730723394
 but the slap and the blessing stood him friend says mr vincent for to make up he taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid wife abbess and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the four fields of all ireland          4.634769104595963
 another then put in his word and they dressed him says he in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his hearts content          4.479778272375092
 by this time the father of the faithful for so they called him was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture          6.813070748920266
 to remedy which our cozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on his hind quarters to show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bulls language and they all after him          4.682778549783637
 ay says another and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself for that was the only colour to his mind and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice saying by the lord harry green is the grass that grows on the ground          4.168608250086539
 and says mr dixon if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in roscommon or the wilds of connemara or a husbandman in sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out hed run amok over half the countryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord harrys orders          4.356503030100639
 there was bad blood between them at first says mr vincent and the lord harry called farmer nicholas all the old nicks in the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and ill meddle in his matters says he          5.183015351086678
 ill make that animal smell hell says he with the help of that good pizzle my father left me          7.621643907413454
 after that says mr vincent the lord harry put his head into a cows drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and pulling it out again told them all his new name          5.303518231560152
 then with the water running off him he got into an old smock and skirt that had belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls language to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what took his fancy the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of cotton or a corkfloat          4.201295278167938
 in short he and the bull of ireland were soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt          7.215002720485171
 they were says mr stephen and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward as the ungrate women were all of one mind made a wherry raft loaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard set all masts erect manned the yards sprang their luff heaved to spread three sheets in the wind put her head between wind and water weighed anchor ported her helm ran up the jolly roger gave three times three let the bullgine run pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of america          4.306675934064364

 our worthy acquaintance mr malachi mulligan now appeared in the doorway as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend whom he had just rencountered a young gentleman his name alec bannon who had late come to town it being his intention to buy a colour or a cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars          5.536471703656399
 mr mulligan was civil enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched on          5.737707969237883
 whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards which he had had printed that day at mr quinnells bearing a legend printed in fair italics mr malachi mulligan          7.212024155143267

 his project as he went on to expound was to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business of sir fopling popinjay and sir milksop quidnunc in town and to devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed          5.000249178798413
 well let us hear of it good my friend said mr dixon          15.286333390284916

 tis as cheap sitting as standing          97.87156484897037
 mr mulligan accepted of the invitation and expatiating upon his design told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility both the inhibitory and the prohibitory whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities acquired          4.88543197196882
 it grieved him plaguily he said to see the nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges and to reflect upon so many agreeable females with rich jointures a prey to the vilest bonzes who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress this he assured them made his heart weep          4.52275989526766
 he proposed to set up there a national fertilising farm to be named omphalos with an obelisk hewn and erected after the fashion of egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her natural          4.650941437758874
 money was no object he said nor would he take a penny for his pains          10.02584151001118
 the poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of fashion if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm persuaders for their petitions would find in him their man          8.330952304637988
 for his nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there the flesh of these latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose both broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum chillies          5.257474245435594
 after this homily which he delivered with much warmth of asseveration mr mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with which he had shielded it          7.5715538689303825
 they both it seems had been overtaken by the rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water as might be observed by mr mulligans smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now somewhat piebald          5.550929993494745
 his project meanwhile was very favourably entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though mr dixon of marys excepted to it asking with a finicking air did he purpose also to carry coals to newcastle          6.283544601497515
 mr mulligan however made court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which as it dwelt upon his memory seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of his contention talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi o quirites ut matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus centurionum romanorum magnopere anteponunt while for those of ruder wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more suitable to their stomach the buck and doe of the forest glade the farmyard drake and duck          4.580005222103129
 valuing himself not a little upon his elegance being indeed a proper man of person this talkative now applied himself to his dress with animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had advanced          5.8498387150194775
 the young gentleman his friend overjoyed as he was at a passage that had late befallen him could not forbear to tell it his nearest neighbour          6.529145280752201
 mr mulligan now perceiving the table asked for whom were those loaves and fishes and seeing the stranger he made him a civil bow and said pray sir was you in need of any professional assistance we could give          5.728203501334666
 who upon his offer thanked him very heartily though preserving his proper distance and replied that he was come there about a lady now an inmate of hornes house that was in an interesting condition poor body from womans woe and here he fetched a deep sigh to know if her happiness had yet taken place          4.9082953223526875
 mr dixon to turn the table took on to ask of mr mulligan himself whether his incipient ventripotence upon which he rallied him betokened an ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due as with the noted physician mr austin meldon to a wolf in the stomach          5.102674524002284
 for answer mr mulligan in a gale of laughter at his smalls smote himself bravely below the diaphragm exclaiming with an admirable droll mimic of mother grogan the most excellent creature of her sex though tis pity shes a trollop theres a belly that never bore a bastard          5.043874378034986
 this was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight          6.218861480855595
 here the listener who was none other than the scotch student a little fume of a fellow blond as tow congratulated in the liveliest fashion with the young gentleman and interrupting the narrative at a salient point having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by a questioning poise of the head a whole century of polite breeding had not achieved so nice a gesture to which was united an equivalent but contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it          4.211848839655341
 mais bien sûr noble stranger said he cheerily et mille compliments          66.00142195590958

 with these words he approached the goblet to his lips took a complacent draught of the cordial slicked his hair and opening his bosom out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband that very picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein          5.279781049468746

 eventually however both their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other was endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid sought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out with also at the same time however a considerable degree of attentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it about the place          4.5011863153751035

 lastly at the head of the board was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of socratic discussion while to right and left of him were accommodated the flippant prognosticator fresh from the hippodrome and that vigilant wanderer soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an indelible dishonour but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired pencil of lafayette has limned for ages yet to come          4.019054509452127

 bloom holding in his hand stephens hat festooned with shavings and ashplant stands irresolute          9.821881027409859

 the name if you call          41.99986225227548
 he bends again and hesitating brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form          8.590169988425023
 stephen          529.8618556701031
 there is no answer          59.552863350716464
 he calls again          626.2138847785654

 to breathe          1489.456470202601
 he brushes the woodshavings from stephens clothes with light hand and fingers          11.722354309433939

 silent thoughtful alert he stands on guard his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master          14.533757146824373
 against the dark wall a figure appears slowly a fairy boy of eleven a changeling kidnapped dressed in an eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet holding a book in his hand          5.268119238634018
 he reads from right to left inaudibly smiling kissing the page          12.742443004527244
 bloom wonderstruck calls inaudibly          999.2964169082726
 rudy          28553.666666666664
 rudy gazes unseeing into blooms eyes and goes on reading kissing smiling          35.18217246658868
 he has a delicate mauve face          21.930364226084176
 on his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons          18.006186654739608
 in his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet bowknot          6.916193225168617
 a white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket          32.56732284778614
 iii preparatory to anything else mr bloom brushed off the greater bulk of the shavings and handed stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up generally in orthodox samaritan fashion which he very badly needed          6.559509859985864
 his stephens mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink mr bloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of vartry water available for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit upon an expedient by suggesting off the reel the propriety of the cabmans shelter as it was called hardly a stonesthrow away near butt bridge where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and soda or a mineral          4.14424357888372
 for the nonce he was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means during which stephen repeatedly yawned          6.338814289015591
 so far as he could see he was rather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly advisable to get a conveyance of some description which would answer in their then condition both of them being e          5.2726497726764405
d          3724.391304347826
ed particularly stephen always assuming that there was such a thing to be found          18.17557396505074
 accordingly after a few such preliminaries as brushing in spite of his having forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman service in the shaving line they both walked together along beaver street or more properly lane as far as the farriers and the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence debouching into amiens street round by the corner of dan bergins          3.895513877503176
 but as he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a jehu plying for hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler probably engaged by some fellows inside on the spree outside the north star hotel and there was no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when mr bloom who was anything but a professional whistler endeavoured to hail it by emitting a kind of a whistle holding his arms arched over his head twice          4.074612892611091
 this was a quandary but bringing common sense to bear on it evidently there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it which they accordingly did          5.074868462003076
 so bevelling around by mulletts and the signal house which they shortly reached they proceeded perforce in the direction of amiens street railway terminus mr bloom being handicapped by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had to vary the timehonoured adage gone the way of all buttons though entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing he heroically made light of the mischance          4.685390174727019
 so as neither of them were particularly pressed for time as it happened and the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after the recent visitation of jupiter pluvius they dandered along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey          5.480895802768961
 as it so happened a dublin united tramways companys sandstrewer happened to be returning and the elder man recounted to his companion à propos of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little while back          4.889300099746038
 they passed the main entrance of the great northern railway station the starting point for belfast where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour and passing the backdoor of the morgue a not very enticing locality not to say gruesome to a degree more especially at night ultimately gained the dock tavern and in due course turned into store street famous for its c division police station          4.252634803494946
 between this point and the high at present unlit warehouses of beresford place stephen thought to think of ibsen associated with bairds the stonecutters in his mind somehow in talbot place first turning on the right while the other who was acting as his fidus achates inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of james rourkes city bakery situated quite close to where they were the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread of all commodities of the public the primary and most indispensable          4.674026140934286
 bread the staff of life earn your bread o tell me where is fancy bread at rourkes the bakers it is said          8.506257492159913
 en route to his taciturn and not to put too fine a point on it not yet perfectly sober companion mr bloom who at all events was in complete possession of his faculties never more so in fact disgustingly sober spoke a word of caution re the dangers of nighttown women of ill fame and swell mobsmen which barely permissible once in a while though not as a habitual practice was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking habits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu for every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick if you didnt look out          4.327991231193665
 highly providential was the appearance on the scene of corny kelleher when stephen was blissfully unconscious but for that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour the finis might have been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward or failing that the bridewell and an appearance in the court next day before mr tobias or he being the solicitor rather old wall he meant to say or mahony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about          4.577496382736902
 the reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those policemen whom he cordially disliked were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the crown and as mr bloom put it recalling a case or two in the a division in clanbrassil street prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot          4.26383461169847
 never on the spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the city pembroke road for example the guardians of the law were well in evidence the obvious reason being they were paid to protect the upper classes          4.945003348900391
 another thing he commented on was equipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description liable to go off at any time which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians should by any chance they fall out over anything          5.6663720483444
 you frittered away your time he very sensibly maintained and health and also character besides which the squandermania of the thing fast women of the demimonde ran away with a lot of           7.052927962836487
 d          3724.391304347826
 into the bargain and the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though touching the much vexed question of stimulants he relished a glass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and bloodmaking and possessing aperient virtues notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch believer in still never beyond a certain point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of others practically          4.480585431482917
 most of all he commented adversely on the desertion of stephen by all his pubhunting confrères but one a most glaring piece of ratting on the part of his brother medicos under all the circs          4.763791399711259
 and that one was judas stephen said who up to then had said nothing whatsoever of any kind          6.637339244354774
 discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back of the customhouse and passed under the loop line bridge where a brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one attracted their rather lagging footsteps          5.141027957138702
 stephen of his own accord stopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox          4.504729713614436
 he began to remember that this had happened or had been mentioned as having happened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a quondam friend of his fathers gumley          5.074821075358707
 to avoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge          10.476493884900737
 someone saluted you mr bloom said          62.005625686814284
 a figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches saluted again calling night          7.454462082746981
 stephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the compliment          11.009857057949052
 mr bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch as he always believed in minding his own business moved off but nevertheless remained on the qui vive with just a shade of anxiety though not funkyish in the least          6.279293627498867
 though unusual in the dublin area he knew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next to nothing to live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising peaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some secluded spot outside the city proper famished loiterers of the thames embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply marauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell swoop at a moments notice your money or your life leaving you there to point a moral gagged and garrotted          4.589268980641683
 stephen that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters though he was not in an over sober state himself recognised corleys breath redolent of rotten cornjuice          5.579571343247917
 lord john corley some called him and his genealogy came about in this wise          16.754447194702454
 he was the eldest son of inspector corley of the g division lately deceased who had married a certain katherine brophy the daughter of a louth farmer          4.7564651595867975
 his grandfather patrick michael corley of new ross had married the widow of a publican there whose maiden name had been katherine also talbot          8.292776275734116
 rumour had it though not proved that she descended from the house of the lords talbot de malahide in whose mansion really an unquestionably fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing her mother or aunt or some relative a woman as the tale went of extreme beauty had enjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen          4.668679856849513
 this therefore was the reason why the still comparatively young though dissolute man who now addressed stephen was spoken of by some with facetious proclivities as lord john corley          6.460965413434035
 taking stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell          11.848042364964087
 not as much as a farthing to purchase a nights lodgings          9.451478345248292
 his friends had all deserted him          40.258573452073804
 furthermore he had a row with lenehan and called him to stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of other uncalledfor expressions          6.757132974631029
 he was out of a job and implored of stephen to tell him where on gods earth he could get something anything at all to do          4.998365222999114
 no it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected through the mother in some way both occurrences happening at the same time if the whole thing wasnt a complete fabrication from start to finish          4.148543194264431
 anyhow he was all in          54.70858388735922
 i wouldnt ask you only pursued he on my solemn oath and god knows im on the rocks          9.870478073523829
 therell be a job tomorrow or next day stephen told him in a boys school at dalkey for a gentleman usher          8.166354153378352
 mr garrett deasy          6386.1705130675755
 try it          752.3484695029515
 you may mention my name          130.05146453646688
 ah god corley replied sure i couldnt teach in a school man          22.179184832713634
 i was never one of your bright ones he added with a half laugh          9.464847524113091
 i got stuck twice in the junior at the christian brothers          16.415762652993642
 i have no place to sleep myself stephen informed him          14.518856511408925
 corley at the first gooff was inclined to suspect it was something to do with stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart off the street          5.680437473736554
 there was a dosshouse in marlborough street mrs maloneys but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but mconachie told him you got a decent enough do in the brazen head over in winetavern street which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed of friar bacon for a bob          4.569381077628765
 he was starving too though he hadnt said a word about it          14.637012730708806
 though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it still stephens feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew that corleys brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was hardly deserving of much credence          5.3570197609257955
 however haud ignarus malorum miseris succurrere disco etcetera as the latin poet remarks especially as luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished          4.639802819543634
 but the cream of the joke was nothing would get it out of corleys head that he was living in affluence and hadnt a thing to do but hand out the needful          5.411427424219067
 whereas          19767.923076923078
 he put his hand in a pocket anyhow not with the idea of finding any food there but thinking he might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat but the result was in the negative for to his chagrin he found his cash missing          4.63902001920888
 a few broken biscuits were all the result of his investigation          17.816988981439035
 he tried his hardest to recollect for the moment whether he had lost as well he might have or left because in that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout very much the reverse in fact          5.356370869929635
 he was altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough search though he tried to recollect          9.659285145175037
 about biscuits he dimly remembered          102.66524129003629
 who now exactly gave them he wondered or where was or did he buy          13.560733233060262
 however in another pocket he came across what he surmised in the dark were pennies erroneously however as it turned out          7.949148309550379
 those are halfcrowns man corley corrected him          68.41591705073412
 and so in point of fact they turned out to be          5.33240238624283
 stephen anyhow lent him one of them          57.169626417016204
 thanks corley answered youre a gentleman          147.77176710581526
 ill pay you back one time          59.14147290777142
 whos that with you          107.45773025264188
 i saw him a few times in the bleeding horse in camden street with boylan the billsticker          7.52173560826943
 you might put in a good word for us to get me taken on there          9.481136728336706
 id carry a sandwichboard only the girl in the office told me theyre full up for the next three weeks man          8.613593563717139
 god youve to book ahead man youd think it was for the carl rosa          11.032743071885553
 i dont give a shite anyway so long as i get a job even as a crossing sweeper          7.204285041414326
 subsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two and six he got he informed stephen about a fellow by the name of bags comisky that he said stephen knew well out of fullams the shipchandlers bookkeeper there that used to be often round in nagles back with omara and a little chap with a stutter the name of tighe          4.709808258532147
 anyhow he was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and refusing to go with the constable          6.574116768181088
 mr bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation watchmans sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work it struck him was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own private account while dublin slept          3.7780068235531106
 he threw an odd eye at the same time now and then at stephens anything but immaculately attired interlocutor as if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when          4.573273884383988
 being a levelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in point of shrewd observation he also remarked on his very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally testifying to a chronic impecuniosity          6.47058357963309
 palpably he was one of his hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one preying on his nextdoor neighbour all round in every deep so to put it a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude with or without the option of a fine would be a very rara avis altogether          3.5410231759813384
 in any case he had a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning          6.4513790672414
 pretty thick that was certainly          126.32531940409547
 the pair parted company and stephen rejoined mr bloom who with his practised eye was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the blandiloquence of the other parasite          6.986340559303354
 alluding to the encounter he said laughingly stephen that is he is down on his luck          6.8826543468590025
 he asked me to ask you to ask somebody named boylan a billsticker to give him a job as a sandwichman          5.579487212010804
 at this intelligence in which he seemingly evinced little interest mr bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the direction of a bucketdredger rejoicing in the farfamed name of eblana moored alongside customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair whereupon he observed evasively everybody gets their own ration of luck they say          4.660179710344018
 now you mention it his face was familiar to me          19.816787295618457
 but leaving that for the moment how much did you part with he queried if i am not too inquisitive          8.146328927147708
 half a crown stephen responded          95.2323349071384
 i daresay he needs it to sleep somewhere          29.8078450385156
 needs          51396.6
 mr bloom ejaculated professing not the least surprise at the intelligence i can quite credit the assertion and i guarantee he invariably does          9.469901020863517
 but talking about things in general where added he with a smile will you sleep yourself          10.084184479656212
 walking to sandycove is out of the question          29.404043409265128
 and even supposing you did you wont get in after what occurred at westland row station          9.73543649639644
 simply fag out there for nothing          103.3673812761609
 i dont mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why did you leave your fathers house          8.413068075707502
 to seek misfortune was stephens answer          142.32639563710953
 i met your respected father on a recent occasion mr bloom diplomatically returned today in fact or to be strictly accurate on yesterday          7.360876140284488
 where does he live at present          44.01146028636829
 i gathered in the course of conversation that he had moved          9.721347127251835
 i believe he is in dublin somewhere stephen answered unconcernedly          13.994570013053371
 a gifted man mr bloom said of mr dedalus senior in more respects than one and a born raconteur if ever there was one          7.003722140668124
 he takes great pride quite legitimate out of you          22.764079322976
 you could go back perhaps he hasarded still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at westland row terminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two mulligan that is and that english tourist friend of his who eventually euchred their third companion were patently trying as if the whole bally station belonged to them to give stephen the slip in the confusion which they did          4.687203105722213
 there was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however such as it was stephens minds eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his family hearth the last time he saw it with his sister dilly sitting by the ingle her hair hanging down waiting for some weak trinidad shell cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he could drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the friday herrings they had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for maggy boody and katey the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper in accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on the days commanded it being quarter tense or if not ember days or something like that          4.007721959585572
 no mr bloom repeated again i wouldnt personally repose much trust in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element dr mulligan as a guide philosopher and friend if i were in your shoes          5.698435376169535
 he knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he never realised what it is to be without regular meals          4.22587010780627
 of course you didnt notice as much as i did          11.830452590151546
 but it wouldnt occasion me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in your drink for some ulterior object          6.592690527137615
 he understood however from all he heard that dr mulligan was a versatile allround man by no means confined to medicine only who was rapidly coming to the fore in his line and if the report was verified bade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid at skerries or malahide was it          4.645981753392676
 was he was bound to admit an exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise so that frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or jealousy pure and simple          4.5725065855057005
 except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking your brains he ventured to throw out          8.893922824799914
 the guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by friendliness which he gave at stephens at present morose expression of features did not throw a flood of light none at all in fact on the problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge by two or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about saw through the affair and for some reason or other best known to himself allowed matters to more or less          4.552276656724515
 grinding poverty did have that effect and he more than conjectured that high educational abilities though he possessed he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet          8.911862738503418
 adjacent to the mens public urinal they perceived an icecream car round which a group of presumably italians in heated altercation were getting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a particularly animated way there being some little differences between the parties          5.243625415128157

 mr bloom and stephen entered the cabmans shelter an unpretentious wooden structure where prior to then he had rarely if ever been before the former having previously whispered to the latter a few hints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous skinthegoat fitzharris the invincible though he could not vouch for the actual facts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in          4.339008743643068
 a few moments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the genus homo already there engaged in eating and drinking diversified by conversation for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity          5.113857019965498
 now touching a cup of coffee mr bloom ventured to plausibly suggest to break the ice it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the shape of solid food say a roll of some description          4.978135503082597
 accordingly his first act was with characteristic sangfroid to order these commodities quietly          14.00120040142016
 the hoi polloi of jarvies or stevedores or whatever they were after a cursory examination turned their eyes apparently dissatisfied away though one redbearded bibulous individual portion of whose hair was greyish a sailor probably still stared for some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention to the floor          6.334008256583222
 mr bloom availing himself of the right of free speech he having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute though to be sure rather in a quandary over voglio remarked to his protégé in an audible tone of voice à propos of the battle royal in the street which was still raging fast and furious a beautiful language          5.288193814943001
 i mean for singing purposes          61.56070002000871

 stephen who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could suffering from lassitude generally replied to fill the ear of a cow elephant          5.990582279258245
 they were haggling over money          217.4846917312805
 is that so          168.50148649853375
 of course he subjoined pensively at the inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were absolutely necessary it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds it          5.6612415206007345
 the keeper of the shelter in the middle of this têteàtête put a boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun or so it seemed          4.146959755227369
 after which he beat a retreat to his counter mr bloom determining to have a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to          5.090357757486029
 for which reason he encouraged stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did the honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was temporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him          5.828011731797995
 sounds are impostures stephen said after a pause of some little time like names          21.278820361664906

 yes to be sure mr bloom unaffectedly concurred          18.030605423477812
 of course          367.37628555086786
 our name was changed too he added pushing the socalled roll across          12.641441581579974
 the redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded stephen whom he had singled out for attention in particular squarely by asking and what might your name be          7.023901650508342
 just in the nick of time mr bloom touched his companions boot but stephen apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected quarter answered dedalus          5.615543231464791
 the sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes rather bunged up from excessive use of boose preferably good old hollands and water          7.173660296918363
 you know simon dedalus          228.27286444815627
 he asked at length          82.81050920514117
 ive heard of him stephen said          56.792423073385
 mr bloom was all at sea for a moment seeing the others evidently eavesdropping too          9.152602469106588
 hes irish the seaman bold affirmed staring still in much the same way and nodding          9.221458486178424
 all irish          635.2334881965912
 all too irish stephen rejoined          68.17183874859656
 as for mr bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor of his own accord turned to the other occupants of the shelter with the remark i seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his shoulder          4.578811112011707
 the lefthand dead shot          394.546293892884
 though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his gestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain          6.354802864383947
 bottles out there say          249.86325174528338
 fifty yards measured          20131.708724373875
 eggs on the bottles          87.42766103019403

 aims          128491.49999999999
 he turned his body half round shut up his right eye completely          10.410764551730756
 then he screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the night with an unprepossessing cast of countenance          8.792175384395987
 he then shouted once          180.50242092350786
 the entire audience waited anticipating an additional detonation there being still a further egg          14.782140327797832
 he shouted twice          1236.5343444548246
 egg two evidently demolished he nodded and winked adding bloodthirstily buffalo bill shoots to kill never missed nor he never will          10.517108197341354
 a silence ensued till mr bloom for agreeableness sake just felt like asking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the bisley          8.15207378680368
 beg pardon the sailor said          159.4236024882142
 long ago          2579.733585895822
 mr bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth          59.62538314849608
 why the sailor replied relaxing to a certain extent under the magic influence of diamond cut diamond it might be a matter of ten years          7.056011303290666
 he toured the wide world with henglers royal circus          18.084975221736002

 shes my own true wife i havent seen for seven years now sailing about          13.258944015327799
 mr bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene the homecoming to the mariners roadside shieling after having diddled davy jones a rainy night with a blind moon          6.424180378069122
 across the world for a wife          22.424629421852007

 the sailor who scarcely seemed to be a dublin resident turned to one of the jarvies with the request you dont happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you          5.523408290675226
 the jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die of plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was passed from hand to hand          6.376247786490192
 thank you the sailor said          55.40471886935704

 you must have seen a fair share of the world the keeper remarked leaning on the counter          7.86135643322465

 he fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed to be in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table          6.493085858280808

 mr bloom without evincing surprise unostentatiously turned over the card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark          8.853469057067565
 it ran as follows tarjeta postal señor a boudin galeria becche santiago chile          11.24032162234703
 there was no message evidently as he took particular notice          14.540899116116922
 though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated or the eggsniping transaction for that matter despite william tell and the lazarillodon cesar de bazan incident depicted in maritana on which occasion the formers ball passed through the latters hat having detected a discrepancy between his name assuming he was the person he represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after having boxed the compass on the strict q          4.672993640804753

 the trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone and be in every way thoroughly pleasurable especially for a chap whose liver was out of order seeing the different places along the route plymouth falmouth southampton and so on culminating in an instructive tour of the sights of the great metropolis the spectacle of our modern babylon where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement tower abbey wealth of park lane to renew acquaintance with          4.460820647354066
 another thing just struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze around on the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a concert tour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure resorts margate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spas eastbourne scarborough margate and so on beautiful bournemouth the channel islands and similar bijou spots which might prove highly remunerative          4.803361072170507

 but who          397.79563649443435
 that was the rub          31.35217728245448
 also without being actually positive it struck him a great field was to be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with the times apropos of the fishguardrosslare route which it was mooted was once more on the tapis in the circumlocution departments with the usual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete fogeydom and dunderheads generally          4.957680722802282

 it was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no small blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street when the system really needed toning up for the matter of a couple of paltry pounds was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in instead of being always and ever cooped up since my old stickinthemud took me for a wife          3.600400407844775

 because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely in its infancy so to speak and the accommodation left much to be desired          6.866937618801632
 interesting to fathom it seemed to him from a motive of curiosity pure and simple was whether it was the traffic that created the route or viceversa or the two sides in fact          6.652846955257918

 and stephen each in his own particular way both instinctively exchanged meaning glances in a religious silence of the strictly entre nous variety however towards where skinthegoat alias the keeper not turning a hair was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair          5.197088350883678
 his inscrutable face which was really a work of art a perfect study in itself beggaring description conveyed the impression that he didnt understand one jot of what was going on          6.758960380867343

 there ensued a somewhat lengthy pause          47.78175926338435
 one man was reading in fits and starts a stained by coffee evening journal another the card with the natives choza de another the seamans discharge          5.8276725021577445
 mr bloom so far as he was personally concerned was just pondering in pensive mood          8.947032063904892
 he vividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well as yesterday roughly some score of years previously in the days of the land troubles when it took the civilised world by storm figuratively speaking early in the eighties eightyone to be correct when he was just turned fifteen          5.530839180698768
 ay boss the sailor broke in          62.91768964193148
 give us back them papers          104.8174124770515
 the request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape          11.793113021171814
 have you seen the rock of gibraltar          24.15699203365189
 mr bloom inquired          3348.773880033925
 the sailor grimaced chewing in a way that might be read as yes ay or no          10.718317144298046
 ah youve touched there too mr bloom said europa point thinking he had in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but he failed to do so simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the sawdust and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn          5.838509670635143
 what year would that be about          55.229274944962825
 mr b interrogated          4281.326393528887
 can you recall the boats          142.96112043707097
 our soidisant sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before answering im tired of all them rocks in the sea he said and boats and ships          9.67494831691528
 salt junk all the time          322.31850937527435
 tired seemingly he ceased          465.9017980586485
 his questioner perceiving that he was not likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer fell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the globe suffice it to say that as a casual glance at the map revealed it covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly what it meant to rule the waves          4.991220001968208
 on more than one occasion a dozen at the lowest near the north bull at dollymount he had remarked a superannuated old salt evidently derelict seated habitually near the not particularly redolent sea on the wall staring quite obliviously at it and it at him dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone somewhere sings          4.693603309936715
 and it left him wondering why          25.91570104086111
 and the odds were twenty to nil there was really no secret about it at all          8.946690420827647
 nevertheless without going into the minutiae of the business the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of things somebody or other had to sail on it and fly in the face of providence though it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that sort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery and insurance which were run on identically the same lines so that for that very reason if no other lifeboat sunday was a highly laudable institution to which the public at large no matter where living inland or seaside as the case might be having it brought home to them like that should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and coastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid the elements whatever the season when duty called ireland expects that every man and so on and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the wintertime not forgetting the irish lights kish and others liable to capsize at any moment rounding which he once with his daughter had experienced some remarkably choppy not to say stormy weather          3.9631253918757126
 there was a fellow sailed with me in the rover the old seadog himself a rover proceeded went ashore and took up a soft job as gentlemans valet at six quid a month          4.822736590866498
 im game for that job shaving and brushup          28.86995879910247

 what age is he          159.785954942829
 queried one hearer who by the way seen from the side bore a distant resemblance to henry campbell the townclerk away from the carking cares of office unwashed of course and in a seedy getup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage          6.4796030216250164
 why the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance my son danny          12.076640952208132
 hed be about eighteen now way i figure it          22.41110364245782
 the skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to be seen an image tattooed in blue chinese ink intended to represent an anchor          5.54726548338283
 there was lice in that bunk in bridgwater he remarked sure as nuts          15.300498530267733
 i must get a wash tomorrow or next day          14.169456021169433

 suck your blood dry they does          105.44632273603106
 seeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly dragged his shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the mariners hope and rest they had a full view of the figure and a young mans sideface looking frowningly rather          5.452120030137284
 that was done when we were lying becalmed off odessa in the black sea under captain dalton          8.480332688117041

 did it hurt much doing it          60.75126126970663
 one asked the sailor          71.99269887651418
 that worthy however was busily engaged in collecting round the          23.17006656810442
 someway in his          365.00809419535994
 squeezing or          5540.1277237510385
 see here he said showing antonio          33.48495959465567
 there he is cursing the mate          25.92176787210161
 and there he is now he added the same fellow pulling the skin with his fingers some special knack evidently and he laughing at a yarn          5.188800300485342
 and in point of fact the young man named antonios livid face did actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the unreserved admiration of everybody including skinthegoat who this time stretched over          4.861872248597929
 hes gone too          1020.3915717105198

 ay ay          6495.153432779654
 he let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression of before          8.09495875035393
 neat bit of work one longshoreman said          40.245294360116674
 and whats the number for          30.5516672210828
 loafer number two queried          752.7593867641921
 eaten alive          12389.221653804148
 a third asked the sailor          85.42878538589447
 ay ay sighed again the latter personage more cheerily this time with some sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the direction of the questioner about the number          6.430227164299024
 ate          10707.625
 a greek he was          92.37389112352008
 and then he added with rather gallowsbird humour considering his alleged end as bad as old antonio for he left me on my ownio          4.789296675224267
 the face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat peered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on her own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill          4.386342504072421
 mr bloom scarcely knowing which way to look turned away on the moment flusterfied but outwardly calm and picking up from the table the pink sheet of the abbey street organ which the jarvey if such he was had laid aside he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink          5.028695142854192
 his reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on ormond quay the partially idiotic female namely of the lane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you mrs b          4.3476128012360595
 and begged the chance of his washing          22.40652900723918
 also why washing which seemed rather vague than not your washing          24.605390321526684
 still candour compelled him to admit he had washed his wifes undergarments when soiled in holles street and women would and did too a mans similar garments initialled with bewley and drapers marking ink hers were that is if they really loved him that is to say love me love my dirty shirt          5.625755176254869
 still just then being on tenterhooks he desired the females room more than her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude sign to take herself off          6.101760576544043
 round the side of the evening telegraph he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was not exactly all there viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers round skipper murphys nautical chest and then there was no more of her          3.7238280325726074
 the gunboat the keeper said          62.34880058224303
 it beats me mr bloom confided to stephen medically i am speaking how a wretched creature like that from the lock hospital reeking with disease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses if he values his health in the least          5.046605934480895
 unfortunate creature          16604.588198066143
 of course i suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition          9.575410463636727
 still no matter what the cause is from          32.06683273610571
 stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders merely remarking in this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a roaring trade          6.354003871361664
 fear not them that sell the body but have not power to buy the soul          10.82605602248381
 she is a bad merchant          29.00964238693962
 she buys dear and sells cheap          108.88828070949698
 the elder man though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a stop to instanter to say that women of that stamp quite apart from any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject a necessary evil were not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities a thing he could truthfully state he as a paterfamilias was a stalwart advocate of from the very first start          4.462637919745686
 you as a good catholic he observed talking of body and soul believe in the soul          6.815766057017401
 or do you mean the intelligence the brainpower as such as distinct from any outside object the table let us say that cup          6.763614773487858
 i believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as the convolutions of the grey matter          7.019030953892451
 otherwise we would never have such inventions as x rays for instance          17.004424679826755
 do you          347.9374700514636
 thus cornered stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try and concentrate and remember before he could say they tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and therefore incorruptible          7.24247538314911
 it would be immortal i understand but for the possibility of its annihilation by its first cause who from all i can hear is quite capable of adding that to the number of his other practical jokes corruptio per se and corruptio per accidens both being excluded by court etiquette          4.874469152292411
 mr bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple promptly rejoining simple          6.065661551311917
 of course i grant you to concede a point you do knock across a simple soul once in a blue moon          5.963173524213039
 but what i am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for instance to invent those rays röntgen did or the telescope like edison though i believe it was before his time galileo was the man i mean and the same applies to the laws for example of a farreaching natural phenomenon such as electricity but its a horse of quite another colour to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural god          4.411186830309661
 o that stephen expostulated has been proved conclusively by several of the bestknown passages in holy writ apart from circumstantial evidence          7.21391873525076
 on this knotty point however the views of the pair poles apart as they were both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference in their respective ages clashed          6.866072935019629
 the more experienced of the two objected sticking to his original point with a smile of unbelief          9.534713785881674
 im not so sure about that          43.753836189936834
 thats a matter for everymans opinion and without dragging in the sectarian side of the business i beg to differ with you in toto there          6.993447282656394
 my belief is to tell you the candid truth that those bits were genuine forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or its the big question of our national poet over again who precisely wrote them like hamlet and bacon as you who know your shakespeare infinitely better than i of course i neednt tell you          4.738960810048694
 cant you drink that coffee by the way          30.970245406409767
 let me stir it          446.06141442089614

 faultfinding being a proverbially bad hat mr bloom thought well to stir or try to the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with something approaching acrimony on the coffee palace and its temperance and lucrative work          6.266232803318162
 to be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or nay did a world of good shelters such as the present one they were in run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night concerts dramatic evenings and useful lectures admittance free by qualified men for the lower orders          4.511259437958841
 on the other hand he had a distinct and painful recollection they paid his wife madam marion tweedy who had been prominently associated with it at one time a very modest remuneration indeed for her pianoplaying          4.033503111793791

 have a shot at it now he ventured to say of the coffee after being stirred          9.502062501255027
 thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it stephen lifted the heavy mug from the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle and took a sip of the offending beverage          7.070687851558846
 still its solid food his good genius urged im a stickler for solid food his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but regular meals as the sine qua non for any kind of proper work mental or manual          6.040516352688061

 but o oblige me by taking away that knife          34.41976621878037
 i cant look at the point of it          21.19899022268598
 it reminds me of roman history          53.191794540824276
 mr bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly roman or antique about it to the lay eye observing that the point was the least conspicuous point about it          6.115645205274955

 though a wellpreserved man of no little stamina if a trifle prone to baldness there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity          5.69694280928696
 he might even have done for his man supposing it was his own case he told as people often did about others namely that he killed him himself and had served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say nothing of the antonio personage no relation to the dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen of our national poet who expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above described          4.4339105171088535
 on the other hand he might be only bluffing a pardonable weakness because meeting unmistakable mugs dublin residents like those jarvies waiting news from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner hesperus and etcetera          4.412866109700708
 and when all was said and done the lies a fellow told about himself couldnt probably hold a proverbial candle to the wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him          5.47738325349936

 in those waxworks in henry street i myself saw some aztecs as they are called sitting bowlegged they couldnt straighten their legs if you paid them because the muscles here you see he proceeded indicating on his companion the brief outline of the sinews or whatever you like to call them behind the right knee were utterly powerless from sitting that way so long cramped up being adored as gods          4.65773785920078

 however reverting to friend sinbad and his horrifying adventures who reminded him a bit of ludwig alias ledwidge when he occupied the boards of the gaiety when michael gunn was identified with the management in the flying dutchman a stupendous success and his host of admirers came in large numbers everyone simply flocking to hear him though ships of any sort phantom or the reverse on the stage usually fell a bit flat as also did trains there was nothing intrinsically incompatible about it he conceded          4.834969197594562

 then stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown listener somewhere we have the impetuosity of dante and the isosceles triangle miss portinari he fell in love with and leonardo and san tommaso mastino          5.476738866779317

 coincidence i just happened to be in the kildare street museum today shortly prior to our meeting if i can so call it and i was just looking at those antique statues there          4.665708296710321
 the splendid proportions of hips bosom          91.55103805598709

 handsome yes pretty in a way you find but what im talking about is the female form          12.59776479724781
 besides they have so little taste in dress most of them which greatly enhances a womans natural beauty no matter what you say          7.884586445171398
 rumpled stockings it may be possibly is a foible of mine but still its a thing i simply hate to see          9.874930001640156
 interest however was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the others got on to talking about accidents at sea ships lost in a fog collisions with icebergs all that sort of thing          6.003108461903357
 shipahoy of course had his own say to say          30.882268872961838
 he had doubled the cape a few odd times and weathered a monsoon a kind of wind in the china seas and through all those perils of the deep there was one thing he declared stood to him or words to that effect a pious medal he had that saved him          4.652792441729369
 that was the talk of the town that year albert william quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of distinctive merit on the topic for the irish times breakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion petrified with horror          4.074498132732289
 then someone said something about the case of the s          17.55428288449452
 lady cairns of swansea run into by the mona which was on an opposite tack in rather muggyish weather and lost with all hands on deck          7.700702803947746

 she had no water it appears in her hold          16.795462302430984
 at this stage an incident happened          60.568195929521494
 it having become necessary for him to unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat          12.089997001035917
 let me cross your bows mate he said to his neighbour who was just gently dropping off into a peaceful doze          8.957430885172098
 he made tracks heavily slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore due left          6.663867915537051
 while he was in the act of getting his bearings mr bloom who noticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ships rum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his burning interior saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew and applying its nozzle to his lips take a good old delectable swig out of it with a gurgling noise          4.175852208749248
 the irrepressible bloom who also had a shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manœuvre after the counterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared to all intents and purposes could by straining just perceive him when duly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit gaping up at the piers and girders of the loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was all radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved          4.004679296239533
 some person or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by the cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a brief space of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor evidently giving it a wide berth eased himself closer at hand the noise of his bilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the ground where it apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank          4.6408638166216925
 a hoof scooped anyway for new foothold after sleep and harness jingled          23.65475506932447
 slightly disturbed in his sentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of the corporation stones who though now broken down and fast breaking up was none other in stern reality than the gumley aforesaid now practically on the parish rates given the temporary job by pat tobin in all human probability from dictates of humanity knowing him before shifted about and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again in to the arms of morpheus a truly amazing piece of hard lines in its most virulent form on a fellow most respectably connected and familiarised with decent home comforts all his life who came in for a cool a year at one time which of course the doublebarrelled ass proceeded to make general ducks and drakes of          4.38156527427024
 and there he was at the end of his tether after having often painted the town tolerably pink without a beggarly stiver          4.0679810788134265
 he drank needless to be told and it pointed only once more a moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of business ifa big if howeverhe had contrived to cure himself of his particular partiality          5.593449418321831
 all meantime were loudly lamenting the falling off in irish shipping coastwise and foreign as well which was all part and parcel of the same thing          7.442359408039091
 a palgrave murphy boat was put off the ways at alexandra basin the only launch that year          12.997723188891735
 right enough the harbours were there only no ships ever called          13.122736971857375
 there were wrecks and wreckers the keeper said who was evidently au fait          18.50050687738485
 what he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only rock in galway bay when the galway harbour scheme was mooted by a mr worthington or some name like that eh          5.558924325197116
 ask the then captain he advised them how much palmoil the british government gave him for that days work captain john lever of the lever line          6.399826905138619
 am i right skipper          158.77336381867383
 he queried of the sailor now returning after his private potation and the rest of his exertions          5.995480093810819
 that worthy picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words growled in wouldbe music but with great vim some kind of chanty or other in seconds or thirds          6.654529256770773
 mr blooms sharp ears heard him then expectorate the plug probably which it was so that he must have lodged it for the time being in his fist while he did the drinking and making water jobs and found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in question          4.907600559211995
 anyhow in he rolled after his successful libationcumpotation introducing an atmosphere of drink into the soirée boisterously trolling like a veritable son of a seacook the biscuits was as hard as brass and the beef as salt as lots wifes arse          5.1488534613525445
 o johnny lever          6373.706878909418

 after which effusion the redoubtable specimen duly arrived on the scene and regaining his seat he sank rather than sat heavily on the form provided          8.322596418669322
 skinthegoat assuming he was he evidently with an axe to grind was airing his grievances in a forciblefeeble philippic anent the natural resources of ireland or something of that sort which he described in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none on the face of gods earth far and away superior to england with coal in large quantities six million pounds worth of pork exported every year ten millions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained out of it by england levying taxes on the poor people that paid through the nose always and gobbling up the best meat in the market and a lot more surplus steam in the same vein          4.318846025680919
 their conversation accordingly became general and all agreed that that was a fact          19.289764890876196
 you could grow any mortal thing in irish soil he stated and there was that colonel everard down there in navan growing tobacco          8.160611744433465
 where would you find anywhere the like of irish bacon          15.353350850480444
 but a day of reckoning he stated crescendo with no uncertain voice thoroughly monopolising all the conversation was in store for mighty england despite her power of pelf on account of her crimes          5.192812316029676
 there would be a fall and the greatest fall in history          13.395108390490972
 the germans and the japs were going to have their little lookin he affirmed          10.428779563286867
 the boers were the beginning of the end          24.728160288582902
 brummagem england was toppling already and her downfall would be ireland her achilles heel which he explained to them about the vulnerable point of achilles the greek hero a point his auditors at once seized as he completely gripped their attention by showing the tendon referred to on his boot          5.912183078020762
 his advice to every irishman was stay in the land of your birth and work for ireland and live for ireland          6.995709650191957
 ireland parnell said could not spare a single one of her sons          17.17183256487543
 silence all round marked the termination of his finale          22.259853149185766
 take a bit of doing boss retaliated that rough diamond palpably a bit peeved in response to the foregoing truism          7.989953703488876
 to which cold douche referring to downfall and so on the keeper concurred but nevertheless held to his main view          7.608407034069863
 whos the best troops in the army          33.57186706555056
 the grizzled old veteran irately interrogated          65.02636083702156

 tell me that          333.0389726312892
 the irish for choice retorted the cabby like campbell facial blemishes apart          9.354623062554612

 you know jem mullins          523.3790372060447
 while allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeper added he cared nothing for any empire ours or his and considered no irishman worthy of his salt that served it          6.937124952239197
 then they began to have a few irascible words when it waxed hotter both needless to say appealing to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long as they didnt indulge in recriminations and come to blows          5.3774058628428385
 from inside information extending over a series of years mr bloom was rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for he was fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channel unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for rather concealed their strength than the opposite          4.651918998940287
 it was quite on a par with the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out and if as time went on that turned out to be how the cat jumped all he could personally say on the matter was that as a host of contingencies equally relevant to the issue might occur ere then it was highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countries even though poles apart          4.032236555815893
 another little interesting point the amours of whores and chummies to put it in common parlance reminded him irish soldiers had as often fought for england as against her more so in fact          6.2322822944292
 and now why          298.618723472735
 so the scene between the pair of them the licensee of the place rumoured to be or have been fitzharris the famous invincible and the other obviously bogus reminded him forcibly as being on all fours with the confidence trick supposing that is it was prearranged as the lookeron a student of the human soul if anything the others seeing least of the game          4.674383919498884
 and as for the lessee or keeper who probably wasnt the other person at all he b          5.973511796055858
 couldnt help feeling and most properly it was better to give people like that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and refuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and their felonsetting there always being the offchance of a dannyman coming forward and turning queens evidence or kings now like denis or peter carey an idea he utterly repudiated          4.962051319696013
 quite apart from that he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle          13.814344434015057
 yet though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in any shape or form he certainly did feel and no denying it while inwardly remaining what he was a certain kind of admiration for a man who had actually brandished a knife cold steel with the courage of his political convictions though personally he would never be a party to any such thing off the same bat as those love vendettas of the south have her or swing for her when the husband frequently after some words passed between the two concerning her relations with the other lucky mortal he having had the pair watched inflicted fatal injuries on his adored one as a result of an alternative postnuptial liaison by plunging his knife into her until it just struck him that fitz nicknamed skinthegoat merely drove the car for the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not if he was reliably informed actually party to the ambush which in point of fact was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on          4.033457534288823
 in any case that was very ancient history by now and as for our friend the pseudo skintheetcetera he had transparently outlived his welcome          7.104548288048651
 he ought to have either died naturally or on the scaffold high          8.067854672578395
 like actresses always farewell positively last performance then come up smiling again          20.53405568330008
 generous to a fault of course temperamental no economising or any idea of the sort always snapping at the bone for the shadow          6.75072856813582
 so similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that mr johnny lever got rid of some           10.625350403834316
 d          3724.391304347826
 in the course of his perambulations round the docks in the congenial atmosphere of the old ireland tavern come back to erin and so on          4.7689833912594946
 then as for the other he had heard not so long before the same identical lingo as he told stephen how he simply but effectually silenced the offender          5.763290409410513
 he took umbrage at something or other that muchinjured but on the whole eventempered person declared i let slip          11.52721034360184
 he called me a jew and in a heated fashion offensively          12.310624677962235
 so i without deviating from plain facts in the least told him his god i mean christ was a jew too and all his family like me though in reality im not          5.5888699213050375
 that was one for him          36.444808696830876
 a soft answer turns away wrath          52.70027904230034
 he hadnt a word to say for himself as everyone saw          10.771182595751936
 am i not right          113.51381075906724
 he turned a long you are wrong gaze on stephen of timorous dark pride at the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to glean in a kind of a way that it wasnt all exactly          4.509296503353048
 ex quibus stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent their two or four eyes conversing christus or bloom his name is or after all any other secundum carnem          9.70802880504186

 it is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to right and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is though every country they say our own distressful included has the government it deserves          5.537682841776188

 where you can live well the sense is if you work          14.811478103481342
 over his untastable apology for a cup of coffee listening to this synopsis of things in general stephen stared at nothing in particular          7.90138349151785
 he could hear of course all kinds of words changing colour like those crabs about ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours of different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere beneath or seemed to          5.486864052148772
 then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or didnt say the words the voice he heard said if you work          6.9768512990702805
 count me out he managed to remark meaning work          24.669527909786428
 the eyes were surprised at this observation because as he the person who owned them pro tem          7.568666768401176
 observed or rather his voice speaking did all must work have to together          15.604717150214265
 i mean of course the other hastened to affirm work in the widest possible sense          7.87041148483524

 each is equally important          361.5406578278306
 you suspect stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh that i may be important because i belong to the faubourg saint patrice called ireland for short          5.77907780731213
 i would go a step farther mr bloom insinuated          17.814492322811194
 but i suspect stephen interrupted that ireland must be important because it belongs to me          12.138192401776399
 what belongs queried mr bloom bending fancying he was perhaps under some misapprehension          20.885151725055934

 stephen patently crosstempered repeated and shoved aside his mug of coffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely adding we cant change the country          7.423422240579676
 let us change the subject          137.41243130511364
 at this pertinent suggestion mr bloom to change the subject looked down but in a quandary as he couldnt tell exactly what construction to put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry          6.165319348655901
 the rebuke of some kind was clearer than the other part          12.4389072431052
 needless to say the fumes of his recent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way foreign to his sober state          7.485741912227749
 probably the homelife to which mr b attached the utmost importance had not been all that was needful or he hadnt been familiarised with the right sort of people          7.755918955303522
 with a touch of fear for the young man beside him whom he furtively scrutinised with an air of some consternation remembering he had just come back from paris the eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister failing to throw much light on the subject however he brought to mind instances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly nipped in the bud of premature decay and nobody to blame but themselves          4.550545126356953
 for instance there was the case of ocallaghan for one the halfcrazy faddist respectably connected though of inadequate means with his mad vagaries among whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a nuisance to everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously sporting in public a suit of brown paper a fact          4.907026105061004

 all the same bloom properly so dubbed was rather surprised at their memories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels and not singly but in their thousands and then complete oblivion because it was twenty odd years          5.1446409421996275

 something evidently riled them in his death          106.20843686067872
 either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when his various different political arrangements were nearing completion or whether it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to change his boots and clothes after a wetting when a cold resulted and failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his room till he eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a fortnight was at an end or quite possibly they were distressed to find the job was taken out of their hands          4.937051246694804
 of course nobody being acquainted with his movements even before there was absolutely no clue as to his whereabouts which were decidedly of the alice where art thou order even prior to his starting to go under several aliases such as fox and stewart so the remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within the bounds of possibility          5.013102900980453
 naturally then it would prey on his mind as a born leader of men which undoubtedly he was and a commanding figure a sixfooter or at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged feet whereas messrs so and so who though they werent even a patch on the former man ruled the roost after their redeeming features were very few and far between          4.820436531009288

 a more prudent course as bloom said to the not over effusive in fact like the distinguished personage under discussion beside him would have been to sound the lie of the land first          6.166168919089553

 this gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair amount of laughter among his entourage          17.580956932044174
 as regards bloom he without the faintest suspicion of a smile merely gazed in the direction of the door and reflected upon the historic story which had aroused extraordinary interest at the time when the facts to make matters worse were made public with the usual affectionate letters that passed between them full of sweet nothings          4.735652008587193
 first it was strictly platonic till nature intervened and an attachment sprang up between them till bit by bit matters came to a climax and the matter became the talk of the town till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few evildisposed however who were resolved upon encompassing his downfall though the thing was public property all along though not to anything like the sensational extent that it subsequently blossomed into          3.948595749775393
 since their names were coupled though since he was her declared favourite where was the particular necessity to proclaim it to the rank and file from the housetops the fact namely that he had shared her bedroom which came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went through the packed court literally electrifying everybody in the shape of witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a particular date in the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment with the assistance of a ladder in night apparel having gained admittance in the same fashion a fact the weeklies addicted to the lubric a little simply coined shoals of money out of          4.185076722295575
 whereas the simple fact of the case was it was simply a case of the husband not being up to the scratch with nothing in common between them beyond the name and then a real man arriving on the scene strong to the verge of weakness falling a victim to her siren charms and forgetting home ties the usual sequel to bask in the loved ones smiles          4.7707116296418315
 the eternal question of the life connubial needless to say cropped up          15.991239742141792

 a magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly augmented obviously by gifts of a high order as compared with the other military supernumerary that is who was just the usual everyday farewell my gallant captain kind of an individual in the light dragoons the th hussars to be accurate and inflammable doubtless the fallen leader that is not the other in his own peculiar way which she of course woman quickly perceived as highly likely to carve his way to fame which he almost bid fair to do till the priests and ministers of the gospel as a whole his erstwhile staunch adherents and his beloved evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman service in the rural parts of the country by taking up the cudgels on their behalf in a way that exceeded their most sanguine expectations very effectually cooked his matrimonial goose thereby heaping coals of fire on his head much in the same way as the fabled asss kick          4.061826571556584
 looking back now in a retrospective kind of arrangement all seemed a kind of dream          11.009280441656854
 and then coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it went without saying you would feel out of place as things always moved with the times          5.964985705989759
 why as he reflected irishtown strand a locality he had not been in for quite a number of years looked different somehow since as it happened he went to reside on the north side          4.8305237170706405
 north or south however it was just the wellknown case of hot passion pure and simple upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the very thing he was saying as she also was spanish or half so types that wouldnt do things by halves passionate abandon of the south casting every shred of decency to the winds          5.149615991432916
 just bears out what i was saying he with glowing bosom said to stephen about blood and the sun          9.117072988277203
 and if i dont greatly mistake she was spanish too          10.803072575025586
 the king of spains daughter stephen answered adding something or other rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you spanish onions and the first land called the deadman and from ramhead to scilly was so and so many          4.586569799791972

 carefully avoiding a book in his pocket sweets of which reminded him by the by of that capel street library book out of date he took out his pocketbook and turning over the various contents it contained rapidly finally he          6.042065685295809
 do you consider by the by he said thoughtfully selecting a faded photo which he laid on the table that a spanish type          9.41963500534933
 stephen obviously addressed looked down on the photo showing a large sized lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she was in the full bloom of womanhood in evening dress cut ostentatiously low for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom with more than vision of breasts her full lips parted and some perfect teeth standing near ostensibly with gravity a piano on the rest of which was in old madrid a ballad pretty in its way which was then all the vogue          4.6870893100150335
 her the ladys eyes dark large looked at stephen about to smile about something to be admired lafayette of westmoreland street dublins premier photographic artist being responsible for the esthetic execution          6.014965811990876

 very like her then          99.44921770260287
 beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his legal wife who he intimated was the accomplished daughter of major brian tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a singer having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered barely sweet sixteen          4.778421034332991
 as for the face it was a speaking likeness in expression but it did not do justice to her figure which came in for a lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage in that getup          4.404097563701617
 she could without difficulty he said have posed for the ensemble not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the          8.101585946125395
 he dwelt being a bit of an artist in his spare time on the female form in general developmentally because as it so happened no later than that afternoon he had seen those grecian statues perfectly developed as works of art in the national museum          5.465972302570994
 marble could give the original shoulders back all the symmetry all the rest          17.653534875925637

 whereas no photo could because it simply wasnt art in a word          20.946250098867154
 the spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow jack tars good example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for itself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the beauty for himself her stage presence being frankly a treat in itself which the camera could not at all do justice to          4.98931866680008
 but it was scarcely professional etiquette so          20.08249708798246
 though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet wonderfully cool for the season considering for sunshine after storm          6.260283067969116
 and he did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion          5.176014585003751
 nevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased by opulent curves none the worse for wear however and looked away thoughtfully with the intention of not further increasing the others possible embarrassment while gauging her symmetry of heaving embonpoint          6.003944284117539
 in fact the slight soiling was only an added charm like the case of linen slightly soiled good as new much better in fact with the starch out          5.8080545526244745
 suppose she was gone when he          38.965797759788735
 i looked for the lamp which she told me came into his mind but merely as a passing fancy of his because he then recollected the morning littered bed etcetera and the book about ruby with met him pike hoses sic in it which must have fell down sufficiently appropriately beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies to lindley murray          4.257073692993963
 the vicinity of the young man he certainly relished educated distingué and impulsive into the bargain far and away the pick of the bunch though you wouldnt think he had it in him yet you would          4.968268763307145
 besides he said the picture was handsome which say what you like it was though at the moment she was distinctly stouter          7.004059413904297
 and why not          238.3045119210873
 an awful lot of makebelieve went on about that sort of thing involving a lifelong slur with the usual splash page of gutterpress about the same old matrimonial tangle alleging misconduct with professional golfer or the newest stage favourite instead of being honest and aboveboard about the whole business          5.377969234643431
 how they were fated to meet and an attachment sprang up between the two so that their names were coupled in the public eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy and compromising expressions leaving no loophole to show that they openly cohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and relations when the thing ran its normal course became in due course intimate          4.199812143493889
 then the decree nisi and the kings proctor tries to show cause why and he failing to quash it nisi was made absolute          7.816940778072311
 but as for that the two misdemeanants wrapped up as they largely were in one another could safely afford to ignore it as they very largely did till the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor who filed a petition for the party wronged in due course          4.434853768732809
 he b enjoyed the distinction of being close to erins uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred on the historic fracas when the fallen leaders who notoriously stuck to his guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery leaders trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrated into the printing works of the insuppressible or no it was united ireland a by no means by the by appropriate appellative and broke up the typecases with hammers or something like that all on account of some scurrilous effusions from the facile pens of the obrienite scribes at the usual mudslinging occupation reflecting on the erstwhile tribunes private morals          4.131002322898744
 though palpably a radically altered man he was still a commanding figure though carelessly garbed as usual with that look of settled purpose which went a long way with the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture that their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a pedestal which she however was the first to perceive          4.964113955579178
 as those were particularly hot times in the general hullaballoo bloom sustained a minor injury from a nasty prod of some chaps elbow in the crowd that of course congregated lodging some place about the pit of the stomach fortunately not of a grave character          5.146994361790734
 his hat parnells a silk one was inadvertently knocked off and as a matter of strict history bloom was the man who picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to return it to him and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity who panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat at the time all the same being a gentleman born with a stake in the country he as a matter of fact having gone into it more for the kudos of the thing than anything else whats bred in the bone instilled into him in infancy at his mothers knee in the shape of knowing what good form was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and thanked him with perfect aplomb saying thank you sir though in a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal profession whose headgear bloom also set to rights earlier in the course of the day history repeating itself with a difference after the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave          3.5030698673446143
 on the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes of the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest laughing immoderately pretending to understand everything the why and the wherefore and in reality not knowing their own minds it being a case for the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate husband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from the usual boy jones who happened to come across them at the crucial moment in a loving position locked in one anothers arms drawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord and master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not receive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would overlook the matter and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes though possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as quite possibly there were several others          3.77496047678422
 he personally being of a sceptical bias believed and didnt make the smallest bones about saying so either that man or men in the plural were always hanging around on the waiting list about a lady even supposing she was the best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the sake of argument when neglecting her duties she chose to be tired of wedded life and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentions on her with improper intent the upshot being that her affections centred on another the cause of many liaisons between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty and younger men no doubt as several famous cases of feminine infatuation proved up to the hilt          4.184184487810352
 it was a thousand pities a young fellow blessed with an allowance of brains as his neighbour obviously was should waste his valuable time with profligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last him his lifetime          4.902693774401833
 in the nature of single blessedness he would one day take unto himself a wife when miss right came on the scene but in the interim ladies society was a conditio sine qua non though he had the gravest possible doubts not that he wanted in the smallest to pump stephen about miss ferguson who was very possibly the particular lodestar who brought him down to irishtown so early in the morning as to whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi or triweekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentplaying and walking out leading up to fond lovers ways and flowers and chocs          3.9766982819245644
 to think of him house and homeless rooked by some landlady worse than any stepmother was really too bad at his age          6.4852941672008955
 the queer suddenly things he popped out with attracted the elder man who was several years the others senior or like his father but something substantial he certainly ought to eat even were it only an eggflip made on unadulterated maternal nutriment or failing that the homely humpty dumpty boiled          5.1810055267548165
 he questioned of the slim form and tired though unwrinkled face          15.507978839628587
 some time yesterday stephen said          139.84132673113984

 exclaimed bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow friday          25.89300376193223
 ah you mean its after twelve          70.95372276551832
 the day before yesterday stephen said improving on himself          12.23596459044463
 literally astounded at this piece of intelligence bloom reflected          50.91591783020741
 though they didnt see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there somehow was as if both their minds were travelling so to speak in the one train of thought          5.909388826275282
 at his age when dabbling in politics roughly some score of years previously when he had been a quasi aspirant to parliamentary honours in the buckshot foster days he too recollected in retrospect which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself he had a sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas          4.612536380451385
 for instance when the evicted tenants question then at its first inception bulked largely in peoples mind though it goes without saying not contributing a copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums some of which wouldnt exactly hold water he at the outset in principle at all events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the trend of modern opinion a partiality however which realising his mistake he was subsequently partially cured of and even was twitted with going a step farther than michael davitt in the striking views he at one time inculcated as a backtothelander which was one reason he strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion by our friend at the gathering of the clans in barney kiernans so that he though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of mortals be it repeated departed from his customary habit to give him metaphorically one in the gizzard though so far as politics themselves were concerned he was only too conscious of the casualties invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on fine young fellows chiefly destruction of the fittest in a word          4.090248228399483
 anyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons getting on for one as it was it was high time to be retiring for the night          7.881813868412732
 the crux was it was a bit risky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue somebody having a temper of her own sometimes and spoil the hash altogether as on the night he misguidedly brought home a dog breed unknown with a lame paw not that the cases were either identical or the reverse though he had hurt his hand too to ontario terrace as he very distinctly remembered having been there so to speak          4.635926134728624
 on the other hand it was altogether far and away too late for the sandymount or sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which of the two alternatives          4.3975577168147
 everything pointed to the fact that it behoved him to avail himself to the full of the opportunity all things considered          8.500861783528936
 his initial impression was he was a shade standoffish or not over effusive but it grew on him someway          10.265071321968891
 at all events he wound up by concluding eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent a cup of eppss cocoa and a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat doubled into a pillow at least he would be in safe hands and as warm as a toast on a trivet he failed to perceive any very vast amount of harm in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort was kicked up          4.694379574358088
 a move had to be made because that merry old soul the grasswidower in question who appeared to be glued to the spot didnt appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly beloved queenstown and it was highly likely some spongers bawdyhouse of retired beauties where age was no bar off sheriff street lower would be the best clue to that equivocal characters whereabouts for a few days to come alternately racking their feelings the mermaids with sixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to freeze the marrow of anybodys bones and mauling their largesized charms betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment of large potations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for as to who he in reality was let x equal my right name and address as mr algebra remarks passim          4.188098219486991
 at the same time he inwardly chuckled over his gentle repartee to the blood and ouns champion about his god being a jew          5.22064794805364
 people could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what properly riled them was a bite from a sheep          8.869244711876298
 your god was a jew          31.684827976703303
 because mostly they appeared to imagine he came from carrickonshannon or somewhereabouts in the county sligo          12.902788164679645
 i propose our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection while prudently pocketing her photo as its rather stuffy here you just come home with me and talk things over          7.21577190579852

 ill just pay this lot          148.9875938535531
 the best plan clearly being to clear out the remainder being plain sailing he beckoned while prudently pocketing the photo to the keeper of the shanty who didnt seem to          6.171991816464915
 yes thats the best he assured stephen to whom for the matter of that brazen head or him or anywhere else was all more or less          5.275717091767817

 because he more than suspected he had his fathers voice to bank his hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be just as well by the way no harm to trail the conversation in the direction of that particular red herring just to          4.0523589982090815
 the cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former viceroy earl cadogan had presided at the cabdrivers association dinner in london somewhere          7.027884170654258

 hereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon lord only knows what found drowned or the exploits of king willow iremonger having made a hundred and something second wicket not out for notts during which time completely regardless of ire the keeper was intensely occupied loosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched him as he muttered against whoever it was sold it all of them who were sufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions that is to say either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial remark          4.71008195902021
 to cut a long story short bloom grasping the situation was the first to rise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first and foremost being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for the occasion taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine host as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were not looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming making a grand total of fourpence the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four coppers literally the last of the mohicans he having previously spotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him in unmistakable figures coffee d confectionery do and honestly well worth twice the money once in a way as wetherup used to remark          3.7594603915219085
 come he counselled to close the séance          52.79256753035898
 seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the shelter or shanty together and the élite society of oilskin and company whom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their dolce far niente          5.180751590428404
 stephen who confessed to still feeling poorly and fagged out paused at the for a moment the door          10.34185630932726
 one thing i never understood he said to be original on the spur of the moment          8.802735244968531
 why they put tables upside down at night i mean chairs upside down on the tables in cafés          9.18962024751563
 to which impromptu the neverfailing bloom replied without a moments hesitation saying straight off to sweep the floor in the morning          9.062385382116654
 so saying he skipped around nimbly considering frankly at the same time apologetic to get on his companions right a habit of his by the bye his right side being in classical idiom his tender achilles          5.073924731115306
 the night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though stephen was a bit weak on his pins          7.9485997288197545
 it will the air do you good bloom said meaning also the walk in a moment          7.121443986065912
 the only thing is to walk then youll feel a different man          9.38786509920277
 come          973.4204545454546
 its not far          616.3976939531627
 lean on me          645.8443381452206
 accordingly he passed his left arm in stephens right and led him on accordingly          13.340773309372029
 yes stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange kind of flesh of a different man approach him sinewless and wobbly and all that          6.571805146947971
 anyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones brazier etc          25.662611114673396
 where the municipal supernumerary ex gumley was still to all intents and purposes wrapped in the arms of murphy as the adage has it dreaming of fresh fields and pastures new          5.398822848384708
 and apropos of coffin of stones the analogy was not at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the part of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the time of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class probably the selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings          4.050772975960062
 so they turned on to chatting about music a form of art for which bloom as a pure amateur possessed the greatest love as they made tracks arm in arm across beresford place          6.033228276600762
 wagnerian music though confessedly grand in its way was a bit too heavy for bloom and hard to follow at the first gooff but the music of mercadantes huguenots meyerbeers seven last words on the cross and mozarts twelfth mass he simply revelled in the gloria in that being to his mind the acme of first class music as such literally knocking everything else into a cocked hat          5.0677972854159945
 he infinitely preferred the sacred music of the catholic church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line such as those moody and sankey hymns or bid me to live and i will live thy protestant to be          6.340986655138371
 he also yielded to none in his admiration of rossinis stabat mater a work simply abounding in immortal numbers in which his wife madam marion tweedy made a hit a veritable sensation he might safely say greatly adding to her other laurels and putting the others totally in the shade in the jesuit fathers church in upper gardiner street the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hear her with virtuosos or virtuosi rather          4.656585259178235
 there was the unanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and suffice it to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character there was a generally voiced desire for an encore          3.6339921681095153
 on the whole though favouring preferably light opera of the don giovanni description and martha a gem in its line he had a penchant though with only a surface knowledge for the severe classical school such as mendelssohn          5.351336795859844
 and talking of that taking it for granted he knew all about the old favourites he mentioned par excellence lionels air in martha mappari which curiously enough he had heard or overheard to be more accurate on yesterday a privilege he keenly appreciated from the lips of stephens respected father sung to perfection a study of the number in fact which made all the others take a back seat          4.203030670232321
 stephen in reply to a politely put query said he didnt sing it but launched out into praises of shakespeares songs at least of in or about that period the lutenist dowland who lived in fetter lane near gerard the herbalist who anno ludendo hausi doulandus an instrument he was contemplating purchasing from mr arnold dolmetsch whom b          4.9155844193515925
 did not quite recall though the name certainly sounded familiar for sixtyfive guineas and farnaby and son with their dux and comes conceits and byrd william who played the virginals he said in the queens chapel or anywhere else he found them and one tomkins who made toys or airs and john bull          4.976851022593525
 on the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond the swingchains a horse dragging a sweeper paced on the paven ground brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise bloom was not perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to sixtyfive guineas and john bull          5.169436039857199
 he inquired if it was john bull the political celebrity of that ilk as it struck him the two identical names as a striking coincidence          7.515432708902869
 by the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn which perceiving bloom who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual plucked the others sleeve gently jocosely remarking our lives are in peril tonight          6.105651034574003
 beware of the steamroller          79.58601025890802
 they thereupon stopped          6539.269382994207
 bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth anything like sixtyfive guineas suddenly in evidence in the dark quite near so that it seemed new a different grouping of bones and even flesh because palpably it was a fourwalker a hipshaker a blackbuttocker a taildangler a headhanger putting his hind foot foremost the while the lord of his creation sat on the perch busy with his thoughts          4.487796585032685
 but such a good poor brute he was sorry he hadnt a lump of sugar but as he wisely reflected you could scarcely be prepared for every emergency that might crop up          5.749418774312422
 he was just a big nervous foolish noodly kind of a horse without a second care in the world          7.245395958888983
 but even a dog he reflected take that mongrel in barney kiernans of the same size would be a holy horror to face          6.557205718311302
 but it was no animals fault in particular if he was built that way like the camel ship of the desert distilling grapes into potheen in his hump          5.767761465867943
 nine tenths of them all could be caged or trained nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees          10.863383551229516
 whale with a harpoon hairpin alligator tickle the small of his back and he sees the joke chalk a circle for a rooster tiger my eagle eye          6.545413089218118
 these timely reflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mind somewhat distracted from stephens words while the ship of the street was manœuvring and stephen went on about the highly interesting old          7.686254896076681
 whats this i was saying          73.77182923927401
 ah yes          1817.0457614402446
 my wife he intimated plunging in medias res would have the greatest of pleasure in making your acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind          6.166667403957924
 he looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of stephen image of his mother which was not quite the same as the usual handsome blackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after as he was perhaps not that way built          5.617208575904965
 still supposing he had his fathers gift as he more than suspected it opened up new vistas in his mind such as lady fingalls irish industries concert on the preceding monday and aristocracy in general          5.679055430091594
 exquisite variations he was now describing on an air youth here has end by jans pieter sweelinck a dutchman of amsterdam where the frows come from          8.768905957950796
 even more he liked an old german song of johannes jeep about the clear sea and the voices of sirens sweet murderers of men which boggled bloom a bit von der sirenen listigkeit tun die poeten dichten          5.600643453945943
 these opening bars he sang and translated extempore          61.72149907943277
 bloom nodding said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which he did          9.417660192591487
 a phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that the rarest of boons which bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out could easily if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production such as barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and procure for its fortunate possessor in the near future an entrée into fashionable houses in the best residential quarters of financial magnates in a large way of business and titled people where with his university degree of b          4.538223418925498
 a          40.5848073278585
 it was in fact only a matter of months and he could easily foresee him participating in their musical and artistic conversaziones during the festivities of the christmas season for choice causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes of the fair sex and being made a lot of by ladies out for sensation cases of which as he happened to know were on recordin fact without giving the show away he himself once upon a time if he cared to could easily have          4.1099387353825945
 added to which of course would be the pecuniary emolument by no means to be sneezed at going hand in hand with his tuition fees          6.782946576532483
 not he parenthesised that for the sake of filthy lucre he need necessarily embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of time          7.042922239926352
 but a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or nay and both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a cheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped          4.990218608279781
 besides though taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree original music like that different from the conventional rut would rapidly have a great vogue as it would be a decided novelty for dublins musical world after the usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a confiding public by ivan st austell and hilton st just and their genus omne          5.2874151788050385
 yes beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in his hand and he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a high place in the citys esteem where he could command a stiff figure and booking ahead give a grand concert for the patrons of the king street house given a backerup if one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs so to speak a big if however with some impetus of the goahead sort to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often tripped up a too much fêted prince of good fellows          4.393630601125597
 and it need not detract from the other by one iota as being his own master he would have heaps of time to practise literature in his spare moments when desirous of so doing without its clashing with his vocal career or containing anything derogatory whatsoever as it was a matter for himself alone          4.94397084160883
 in fact he had the ball at his feet and that was the very reason why the other possessed of a remarkably sharp nose for smelling a rat of any sort hung on to him at all          4.82217314599645
 the horse was just then          39.09381622414342
 and later on at a propitious opportunity he purposed bloom did without anyway prying into his private affairs on the fools step in where angels principle advising him to sever his connection with a certain budding practitioner who he noticed was prone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious pretext when not present deprecate him or whatever you like to call it which in blooms humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side of a persons character no pun intended          4.091679549627957
 the horse having reached the end of his tether so to speak halted and rearing high a proud feathering tail added his quota by letting fall on the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish three smoking globes of turds          4.801414164417147
 slowly three times one after another from a full crupper he mired          18.0785456606339
 and humanely his driver waited till he or she had ended patient in his scythed car          9.67549321346653
 side by side bloom profiting by the contretemps with stephen passed through the gap of the chains divided by the upright and stepping over a strand of mire went across towards gardiner street lower stephen singing more boldly but not loudly the end of the ballad          5.007924734160301
 und alle schiffe brücken          9095.081975613557
 the driver never said a word good bad or indifferent but merely watched the two figures as he sat on his lowbacked car both black one full one lean walk towards the railway bridge to be married by father maher          5.7036841224469805
 as they walked they at times stopped and walked again continuing their tête à tête which of course he was utterly out of about sirens enemies of mans reason mingled with a number of other topics of the same category usurpers historical cases of the kind while the man in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in the sleeper car who in any case couldnt possibly hear because they were too far simply sat in his seat near the end of lower gardiner street and looked after their lowbacked car          4.166398322608342
 what parallel courses did bloom and stephen follow returning          39.05209565302833
 starting united both at normal walking pace from beresford place they followed in the order named lower and middle gardiner streets and mountjoy square west then at reduced pace each bearing left gardiners place by an inadvertence as far as the farther corner of temple street then at reduced pace with interruptions of halt bearing right temple street north as far as hardwicke place          5.125475907298232
 approaching disparate at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the circus before georges church diametrically the chord in any circle being less than the arc which it subtends          8.75565391313263
 of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary          14.092659223182446
 music literature ireland dublin paris friendship woman prostitution diet the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and glowlamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees exposed corporation emergency dustbuckets the roman catholic church ecclesiastical celibacy the irish nation jesuit education careers the study of medicine the past day the maleficent influence of the presabbath stephens collapse          4.585888969193806
 did bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respective like and unlike reactions to experience          13.283024154079154
 both were sensitive to artistic impressions musical in preference to plastic or pictorial          17.139309038186383
 both preferred a continental to an insular manner of life a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence          9.687288984335222
 both indurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of heterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox religious national social and ethical doctrines          8.807574391362209
 both admitted the alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual magnetism          17.59709974643664
 were their views on some points divergent          44.70161233156509
 stephen dissented openly from blooms views on the importance of dietary and civic selfhelp while bloom dissented tacitly from stephens views on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature          7.954242412551692
 bloom assented covertly to stephens rectification of the anachronism involved in assigning the date of the conversion of the irish nation to christianity from druidism by patrick son of calpornus son of potitus son of odyssus sent by pope celestine i in the year in the reign of leary to the year or thereabouts in the reign of cormac macart a          5.001860327963931

 suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at sletty and interred at rossnaree          24.93375870822302
 the collapse which bloom ascribed to gastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength accelerated by mental exertion and the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere stephen attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud perceived by both from two different points of observation sandycove and dublin at first no bigger than a womans hand          4.707785115604194
 was there one point on which their views were equal and negative          10.594695546212636
 the influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees          4.316493888228413
 had bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in the past          24.42234974321617
 in with owen goldberg and cecil turnbull at night on public thoroughfares between longwood avenue and leonards corner and leonards corner and synge street and synge street and bloomfield avenue          5.054952790263039
 in with percy apjohn in the evenings reclined against the wall between gibraltar villa and bloomfield house in crumlin barony of uppercross          7.194655478218598
 in occasionally with casual acquaintances and prospective purchasers on doorsteps in front parlours in third class railway carriages of suburban lines          7.546969383156891
 in frequently with major brian tweedy and his daughter miss marion tweedy together and separately on the lounge in matthew dillons house in roundtown          6.29251765497462
 once in and once in with julius juda mastiansky on both occasions in the parlour of his blooms house in lombard street west          4.882724489535594
 what reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates did bloom make before their arrival at their destination          10.018475683586695
 he reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual development and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction of the converse domain of interindividual relations          5.972989042236986
 as in what ways          59.2623992836535
 from inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received existence with existence he was with any as any with any from existence to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived          6.210865442066886
 what act did bloom make on their arrival at their destination          12.892356203091218
 at the housesteps of the th of the equidifferent uneven numbers number eccles street he inserted his hand mechanically into the back pocket of his trousers to obtain his latchkey          6.3375674892247575
 was it there          161.7888190457081
 it was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on the day but one preceding          5.125762414255377
 why was he doubly irritated          48.22990784085205
 because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded himself twice not to forget          7.621016945732839
 what were then the alternatives before the premeditatedly respectively and inadvertently keyless couple          10.511910561556235
 to enter or not to enter          50.51171160853499
 to knock or not to knock          35.91492932720237
 blooms decision          12878.141392497999
 a stratagem          3512.253032555885
 resting his feet on the dwarf wall he climbed over the area railings compressed his hat on his head grasped two points at the lower union of rails and stiles lowered his body gradually by its length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of the area pavement and allowed his body to move freely in space by separating himself from the railings and crouching in preparation for the impact of the fall          4.385164144047333
 did he fall          583.3212837089422

 what discrete succession of images did stephen meanwhile perceive          64.60052260789112
 reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of cp a man lighting a candle of cp a man removing in turn each of his two boots a man leaving the kitchen holding a candle          4.7548991018232405
 did the man reappear elsewhere          42.269628469911865
 after a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the halldoor          8.366560402265604
 the halldoor turned gradually on its hinges          38.24779263187135
 in the open space of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat with his candle          7.432958727066356
 did stephen obey his sign          174.11072805125897
 yes entering softly he helped to close and chain the door and followed softly along the hallway the mans back and listed feet and lighted candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down a turning staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of blooms house          5.564260438286442
 what did bloom do          93.18867785694717
 he extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its flame drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone one for stephen with its back to the area window the other for himself when necessary knelt on one knee composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid resintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons of best abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of messrs flower and mdonald of dolier street kindled it at three projecting points of paper with one ignited lucifer match thereby releasing the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen of the air          4.344489431073423
 of what similar apparitions did stephen think          30.132646939249103
 of others elsewhere in other times who kneeling on one knee or on two had kindled fires for him of brother michael in the infirmary of the college of the society of jesus at clongowes wood sallins in the county of kildare of his father simon dedalus in an unfurnished room of his first residence in dublin number thirteen fitzgibbon street of his godmother miss kate morkan in the house of her dying sister miss julia morkan at ushers island of his aunt sara wife of richie richard goulding in the kitchen of their lodgings at clanbrassil street of his mother mary wife of simon dedalus in the kitchen of number twelve north richmond street on the morning of the feast of saint francis xavier of the dean of studies father butt in the physics theatre of university college stephens green north of his sister dilly delia in his fathers house in cabra          4.012228974845554
 what did stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from the fire towards the opposite wall          7.548391799830409

bit of fun first god help the world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and lownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them i suppose she was pious because no man would look at her twice i hope ill never be like her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a welleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about mr riordan here and mr riordan there i suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her dog smelling my fur and always edging to get up under my petticoats especially then still i like that in him polite to old women like that and waiters and beggars too hes not proud out of nothing but not always if ever he got anything really serious the matter with him its much better for them to go into a hospital where everything is clean but i suppose id have to dring it into him for a month yes and then wed have a hospital nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying there till they throw him out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as much a nun as im not yes because theyre so weak and puling when theyre sick they want a woman to get well if his nose bleeds youd think it was o tragic and that dyinglooking one off the south circular when he sprained his foot at the choir party at the sugarloaf mountain the day i wore that dress miss stack bringing him flowers the worst old ones she could find at the bottom of the basket anything at all to get into a mans bedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying on account of her to never see thy face again though he looked more like a man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same besides i hate bandaging and dosing when he cut his toe with the razor paring his corns afraid hed get bloodpoisoning but if it was a thing i was sick then wed see what attention only of course the woman hides it not to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhere im sure by his appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her so either it was one of those night women if it was down there he was really and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it planning it hynes kept me who did i meet ah yes i met do you remember menton and who else who let me see that big babbyface i saw him and he not long married flirting with a young girl at pooles myriorama and turned my back on him when he slinked out looking quite conscious what harm but he had the impudence to make up to me one time well done to him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all the big stupoes i ever met and thats called a solicitor only for i hate having a long wrangle in bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on the sly if they only knew him as well as i do yes because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something a letter when i came into the front room to show him dignams death in the paper as if something told me and he covered it up with the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably that was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is now so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that i care two straws now who he does it with or knew before that way though id like to find out so long as i dont have the two of them under my nose all the time like that slut that mary we had in ontario terrace padding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell of those painted women off him once or twice i had a suspicion by getting him to come near me when i found the long hair on his coat without that one when i went into the kitchen pretending he was drinking water woman is not enough for them it was all his fault of course ruining servants then proposing that she could eat at our table on christmas day if you please o no thank you not in my house stealing my potatoes and the oysters per doz going out to see her aunt if you please common robbery so it was but i was sure he had something on with that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you have no proof it was her proof o yes her aunt was very fond of oysters but i told her what i thought of her suggesting me to go out to be alone with her i wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters i found in her room the friday she was out that was enough for me a little bit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when i gave her her weeks notice i saw to that better do without them altogether do out the rooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing out the dirt i gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house i couldnt even touch him if i thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar and sloven like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the place in the w c too because she knew she was too well off yes because he couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere and the last time he came on my bottom when was it the night boylan gave my hand a great squeeze going along by the tolka in my hand there steals another i just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb to squeeze back singing the young may moon shes beaming love because he has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said im dining out and going to the gaiety though im not going to give him the satisfaction in any case god knows hes a change in a way not to be always and ever wearing the same old hat unless i paid some nicelooking boy to do it since i cant do it myself a young boy would like me id confuse him a little alone with him if we were id let him see my garters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him seduce him i know what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that frigging drawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this that and the other with the coalman yes with a bishop yes i would because i told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in the jews temples gardens when i was knitting that woollen thing a stranger to dublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and he tired me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it tell me his name who tell me who the german emperor is it yes imagine im him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the world about it people make its only the first time after that its just the ordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man without going and marrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help yourself i wish some man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul almost paralyses you then i hate that confession when i used to go to father corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did where and i said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your person my child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where you sit down yes o lord couldnt he say bottom right out and have done with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put it i forget no father and i always think of the real father what did he want to know for when i already confessed it to god he had a nice fat hand the palm moist always i wouldnt mind feeling it neither would he id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar i wonder did he know me in the box i could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them id like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre married hes too careful about himself then give something to h h the pope for a penance i wonder was he satisfied with me one thing i didnt like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall though i laughed im not a horse or an ass am i i suppose he was thinking of his fathers i wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am i in it who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they stick their bills up with some liqueur id like to sip those richlooking green and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with the opera hats i tasted once with my finger dipped out of that american that had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took the port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because i felt lovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment i popped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up god be merciful to us i thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when i blessed myself and said a hail mary like those awful thunderbolts in gibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and tell you theres no god what could you do if it was running and rushing about nothing only make an act of contrition the candle i lit that evening in whitefriars street chapel for the month of may see it brought its luck though hed scoff if he heard because he never goes to church mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only grey matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when i lit the lamp because he must have come or times with that tremendous big red brute of a thing he has i thought the vein or whatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is not so big after i took off all my things with the blinds down after my hours dressing and perfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a thick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters i think a few dozen he was in great singing voice no i never in all my life felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must have eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with a big hole in the middle of us or like a stallion driving it up into you because thats all they want out of you with that determined vicious look in his eye i had to halfshut my eyes still he hasnt such a tremendous amount of spunk in him when i made him pull out and do it on me considering how big it is so much the better in case any of it wasnt washed out properly the last time i let him finish it in me nice invention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but if someone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what i went through with milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and mina purefoys husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up with a child or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a smell of children off her the one they called budgers or something like a nigger with a shock of hair on it jesusjack the child is a black the last time i was there a squad of them falling over one another and bawling you couldnt hear your ears supposed to be healthy not satisfied till they have us swollen out like elephants or i dont know what supposing i risked having another not off him though still if he was married im sure hed have a fine strong child but i dont know poldy has more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly i suppose it was meeting josie powell and the funeral and thinking about me and boylan set him off well he can think what he likes now if thatll do him any good i know they were spooning a bit when i came on the scene he was dancing and sitting out with her the night of georgina simpsons housewarming and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account of not liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup row over politics he began it not me when he said about our lord being a carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive about everything i was fuming with myself after for giving in only for i knew he was gone on me and the first socialist he said he was he annoyed me so much i couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot of mixedup things especially about the body and the inside i often wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family physician i could always hear his voice talking when the room was crowded and watch him after that i pretended i had a coolness on with her over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you going to and i said over to floey and he made me the present of byrons poems and the three pairs of gloves so that finished that i could quite easily get him to make it up any time i know how id even supposing he got in with her again and was going out to see her somewhere id know if he refused to eat the onions i know plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch him with my veil and gloves on going out kiss then would send them all spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she of course would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him that i wouldnt so much mind id just go to her and ask her do you love him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might imagine he was and make a declaration to her with his plabbery kind of a manner like he did to me though i had the devils own job to get it out of him though i liked him for that it showed he could hold in and wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too the night in the kitchen i was rolling the potato cake theres something i want to say to you only for i put him off letting on i was in a temper with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case i let out too much the night before talking of dreams so i didnt want to let him know more than was good for him she used to be always embracing me josie whenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and when i said i washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did you wash possible the women are always egging on to that putting it on thick when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the indifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what spoils him i dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at that time trying to look like lord byron i said i liked though he was too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged afterwards though she didnt like it so much the day i was in fits of laughing with the giggles i couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling out one after another with the mass of hair i had youre always in great humour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it meant because i used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us not all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault she didnt darken the door much after we were married i wonder what shes got like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time i saw her she must have been just after a row with him because i saw on the moment she was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk about him to run him down what was it she told me o yes that sometimes he used to go to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him just imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that that might murder you any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes mad poldy anyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when he comes in wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he always takes off his hat when he comes up in the street like then and now hes going about in his slippers to look for for a postcard u p up o sweetheart may wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff to extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what could you make of a man like that id rather die times over than marry another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like me to put up with him the way i do know me come sleep with me yes and he knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that mrs maybrick that poisoned her husband for what i wonder in love with some other man yes it was found out on her wasnt she the downright villain to go and do a thing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating drive you mad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask us to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because they cant get on without us white arsenic she put in his tea off flypaper wasnt it i wonder why they call it that if i asked him hed say its from the greek leave us as wise as we were before she must have been madly in love with the other fellow to run the chance of being hanged o she didnt care if that was her nature what could she do besides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they theyre all so different boylan talking about the shape of my foot he noticed at once even before he was introduced when i was in the d b c with poldy laughing and trying to listen i was waggling my foot we both ordered teas and plain bread and butter i saw him looking with his two old maids of sisters when i stood up and asked the girl where it was what do i care with it dropping out of me and that black closed breeches he made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting all myself always with some brandnew fad every other week such a long one i did i forgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that i never got after some robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the irish times lost in the ladies lavatory d b c dame street finder return to mrs marion bloom and i saw his eyes on my feet going out through the turning door he was looking when i looked back and i went there for tea days after in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him because i was crossing them when we were in the other room first he meant the shoes that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that if i only had a ring with the stone for my month a nice aquamarine ill stick him for one and a gold bracelet i dont like my foot so much still i made him spend once with my foot the night after goodwins botchup of a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to mull and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off my stockings lying on the hearthrug in lombard street west and another time it was my muddy boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung i could find but of course hes not natural like the rest of the world that i what did he say i could give points in to katty lanner and beat her what does that mean i asked him i forget what he said because the stoppress edition just passed and the man with the curly hair in the lucan dairy thats so polite i think i saw his face before somewhere i noticed him when i was tasting the butter so i took my time bartell darcy too that he used to make fun of when he commenced kissing me on the choir stairs after i sang gounods ave maria what are we waiting for o my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part which is my brown part he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too my low notes he was always raving about if you can believe him i liked the way he used his mouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a place like that i dont see anything so terrible about it ill tell him about that some day not now and surprise him ay and ill take him there and show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like it or lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an idea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got me so cheap as he did he was times worse himself anyhow begging me to give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming along kenilworth square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and i had to take it off asking me questions is it permitted to enquire the shape of my bedroom so i let him keep it as if i forgot it to think of me when i saw him slip it into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject of drawers thats plain to be seen always skeezing at those brazenfaced things on the bicycles with their skirts blowing up to their navels even when milly and i were out with him at the open air fete that one in the cream muslin standing right against the sun so he could see every atom she had on when he saw me from behind following in the rain i saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner of the harolds cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in the zingari colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat looking slyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they can go and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on it and were not to ask any questions but they want to know where were you where are you going i could feel him coming along skulking after me his eyes on my neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it was getting too warm for him so i halfturned and stopped then he pestered me to say yes till i took off my glove slowly watching him he said my openwork sleeves were too cold for the rain anything for an excuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers the whole blessed time till i promised to give him the pair off my doll to carry about in his waistcoat pocket o maria santisima he did look a big fool dreeping in the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry to look at them and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat i had on with the sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel down in the wet if i didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new raincoat you never know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so savage for it if anyone was passing so i lifted them a bit and touched his trousers outside the way i used to gardner after with my ring hand to keep him from doing worse where it was too public i was dying to find out was he circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do everything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting all the time for his dinner he told me to say i left my purse in the butchers and had to go back for it what a deceiver then he wrote me that letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to any woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we met asking me have i offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw i wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool henny doyle he was always breaking or tearing something in the charades i hate an unlucky man and if i knew what it meant of course i had to say no for form sake dont understand you i said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it used to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in gibraltar with that word i couldnt find anywhere only for children seeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice a day i liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman when he sent me the big poppies because mine was the th then i wrote the night he kissed my heart at dolphins barn i couldnt describe it simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to embrace well like gardner i hope hell come on monday as he said at the same time four i hate people who come at all hours answer the door you think its the vegetables then its somebody and you all undressed or the door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old frostyface goodwin called about the concert in lombard street and i just after dinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at me professor i had to say im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in his way it was impossible to be more respectful nobody to say youre out you have to peep out through the blind like the messengerboy today i thought it was a putoff first him sending the port and the peaches first and i was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was trying to make a fool of me when i knew his tattarrattat at the door he must have been a bit late because it was after when i saw the dedalus girls coming from school i never know the time even that watch he gave me never seems to go properly id want to get it looked after when i threw the penny to that lame sailor for england home and beauty when i was whistling there is a charming girl i love and i hadnt even put on my clean shift or powdered myself or a thing then this day week were to go to belfast just as well he has to go to ennis his fathers anniversary the th it wouldnt be pleasant if he did suppose our rooms at the hotel were beside each other and any fooling went on in the new bed i couldnt tell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next room or perhaps some protestant clergyman with a cough knocking on the wall then hed never believe the next day we didnt do something its all very well a husband but you cant fool a lover after me telling him we never did anything of course he didnt believe me no its better hes going where he is besides something always happens with him the time going to the mallow concert at maryborough ordering boiling soup for the two of us then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with the soup splashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and the waiter after him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion for the engine to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two gentlemen in the rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was too hes so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a good job he was able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd have taken us on to cork i suppose that was done out of revenge on him o i love jaunting in a train or a car with lovely soft cushions i wonder will he take a st class for me he might want to do it in the train by tipping the guard well o i suppose therell be the usual idiots of men gaping at us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly be that was an exceptional man that common workman that left us alone in the carriage that day going to howth id like to find out something about him or tunnels perhaps then you have to look out of the window all the nicer then coming back suppose i never came back what would they say eloped with him that gets you on on the stage the last concert i sang at where its over a year ago when was it st teresas hall clarendon st little chits of missies they have now singing kathleen kearney and her like on account of father being in the army and my singing the absentminded beggar and wearing a brooch for lord roberts when i had the map of it all and poldy not irish enough was it him managed it this time i wouldnt put it past him like he got me on to sing in the stabat mater by going around saying he was putting lead kindly light to music i put him up to that till the jesuits found out he was a freemason thumping the piano lead thou me on copied from some old opera yes and he was going about with some of them sinner fein lately or whatever they call themselves talking his usual trash and nonsense he says that little man he showed me without the neck is very intelligent the coming man griffiths is he well he doesnt look it thats all i can say still it must have been him he knew there was a boycott i hate the mention of their politics after the war that pretoria and ladysmith and bloemfontein where gardner lieut stanley g th bn nd east lancs rgt of enteric fever he was a lovely fellow in khaki and just the right height over me im sure he was brave too he said i was lovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock my irish beauty he was pale with excitement about going away or wed be seen from the road he couldnt stand properly and i so hot as i never felt they could have made their peace in the beginning or old oom paul and the rest of the other old krugers go and fight it out between them instead of dragging on for years killing any finelooking men there were with their fever if he was even decently shot it wouldnt have been so bad i love to see a regiment pass in review the first time i saw the spanish cavalry at la roque it was lovely after looking across the bay from algeciras all the lights of the rock like fireflies or those sham battles on the acres the black watch with their kilts in time at the march past the th hussars the prince of wales own or the lancers o the lancers theyre grand or the dublins that won tugela his father made his money over selling the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me a nice present up in belfast after what i gave him theyve lovely linen up there or one of those nice kimono things i must buy a mothball like i had before to keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting going round with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the knuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or tell the police on me but theyd think were married o let them all go and smother themselves for the fat lot i care he has plenty of money and hes not a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if i could find out whether he likes me i looked a bit washy of course when i looked close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the expression besides scrooching down on me like that all the time with his big hipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat always having to lie down for them better for him put it into me from behind the way mrs mastiansky told me her husband made her like the dogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so quiet and mild with his tingating cither can you ever be up to men the way it takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish tie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly welloff i know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he was like a perfect devil for a few minutes after he came back with the stoppress tearing up the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost quid he said he lost over that outsider that won and half he put on for me on account of lenehans tip cursing him to the lowest pits that sponger he was making free with me after the glencree dinner coming back that long joult over the featherbed mountain after the lord mayor looking at me with his dirty eyes val dillon that big heathen i first noticed him at dessert when i was cracking the nuts with my teeth i wished i could have picked every morsel of that chicken out of my fingers it was so tasty and browned and as tender as anything only for i didnt want to eat everything on my plate those forks and fishslicers were hallmarked silver too i wish i had some i could easily have slipped a couple into my muff when i was playing with them then always hanging out of them for money in a restaurant for the bit you put down your throat we have to be thankful for our mangy cup of tea itself as a great compliment to be noticed the way the world is divided in any case if its going to go on i want at least two other good chemises for one thing and but i dont know what kind of drawers he likes none at all i think didnt he say yes and half the girls in gibraltar never wore them either naked as god made them that andalusian singing her manola she didnt make much secret of what she hadnt yes and the second pair of silkette stockings is laddered after one days wear i could have brought them back to lewers this morning and kicked up a row and made that one change them only not to upset myself and run the risk of walking into him and ruining the whole thing and one of those kidfitting corsets id want advertised cheap in the gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips he saved the one i have but thats no good what did they say they give a delightful figure line obviating that unsightly broad appearance across the lower back to reduce flesh my belly is a bit too big ill have to knock off the stout at dinner or am i getting too fond of it the last they sent from orourkes was as flat as a pancake he makes his money easy larry they call him the old mangy parcel he sent at xmas a cottage cake and a bottle of hogwash he tried to palm off as claret that he couldnt get anyone to drink god spare his spit for fear hed die of the drouth or i must do a few breathing exercises i wonder is that antifat any good might overdo it the thin ones are not so much the fashion now garters that much i have the violet pair i wore today thats all he bought me out of the cheque he got on the first o no there was the face lotion i finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like new i told him over and over again get that made up in the same place and dont forget it god only knows whether he did after all i said to him ill know by the bottle anyway if not i suppose ill only have to wash in my piss like beeftea or chickensoup with some of that opoponax and violet i thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the skin underneath is much finer where it peeled off there on my finger after the burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry handkerchiefs about in all sure you cant get on in this world without style all going in food and rent when i get it ill lash it around i tell you in fine style i always want to throw a handful of tea into the pot measuring and mincing if i buy a pair of old brogues itself do you like those new shoes yes were they ive no clothes at all the brown costume and the skirt and jacket and the one at the cleaners whats that for any woman cutting up this old hat and patching up the other the men wont look at you and women try to walk on you because they know youve no man then with all the things getting dearer every day for the years more i have of life up to no im what am i at all ill be in september will i what o well look at that mrs galbraith shes much older than me i saw her when i was out last week her beautys on the wane she was a lovely woman magnificent head of hair on her down to her waist tossing it back like that like kitty oshea in grantham street st thing i did every morning to look across see her combing it as if she loved it and was full of it pity i only got to know her the day before we left and that mrs langtry the jersey lily the prince of wales was in love with i suppose hes like the first man going the roads only for the name of a king theyre all made the one way only a black mans id like to try a beauty up to what was she there was some funny story about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an oyster knife he went no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and the prince of wales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing like that like some of those books he brings me the works of master francois somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out of her ear because her bumgut fell out a nice word for any priest to write and her ae as if any fool wouldnt know what that meant i hate that pretending of all things with that old blackguards face on him anybody can see its not true and that ruby and fair tyrants he brought me that twice i remember when i came to page the part about where she hangs him up out of a hook with a cord flagellate sure theres nothing for a woman in that all invention made up about he drinking the champagne out of her slipper after the ball was over like the infant jesus in the crib at inchicore in the blessed virgins arms sure no woman could have a child that big taken out of her and i thought first it came out of her side because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and she a rich lady of course she felt honoured h r h he was in gibraltar the year i was born i bet he found lilies there too where he planted the tree he planted more than that in his time he might have planted me too if hed come a bit sooner then i wouldnt be here as i am he ought to chuck that freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it and go into an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank where they could put him up on a throne to count the money all the day of course he prefers plottering about the house so you cant stir with him any side whats your programme today i wish hed even smoke a pipe like father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching about for advertisements when he could have been in mr cuffes still only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up i could have got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great mirada once or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly mrs bloom only i felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress that i lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming into fashion again i bought it simply to please him i knew it was no good by the finish pity i changed my mind of going to todd and burns as i said and not lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale a lot of trash i hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and cooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if i went by his advices every blessed hat i put on does that suit me yes take that thats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles off my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my backside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in grafton street i had the misfortune to bring him into and she as insolent as ever she could be with her smirk saying im afraid were giving you too much trouble what shes there for but i stared it out of her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second time he looked poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but i could see him looking very hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for me it was nice of him to show me out in any case im extremely sorry mrs bloom believe me without making it too marked the first time after him being insulted and me being supposed to be his wife i just half smiled i know my chest was out that way at the door when he said im extremely sorry and im sure you were yes i think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he made me thirsty titties he calls them i had to laugh yes this one anyhow stiff the nipple gets for the least thing ill get him to keep that up and ill take those eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out for him what are all those veins and things curious the way its made the same in case of twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up there like those statues in the museum one of them pretending to hide it with her hand are they so beautiful of course compared with what a man looks like with his two bags full and his other thing hanging down out of him or sticking up at you like a hatrack no wonder they hide it with a cabbageleaf that disgusting cameron highlander behind the meat market or that other wretch with the red head behind the tree where the statue of the fish used to be when i was passing pretending he was pissing standing out for me to see it with his babyclothes up to one side the queens own they were a nice lot its well the surreys relieved them theyre always trying to show it to you every time nearly i passed outside the mens greenhouse near the harcourt street station just to try some fellow or other trying to catch my eye as if it was of the wonders of the world o and the stink of those rotten places the night coming home with poldy after the comerfords party oranges and lemonade to make you feel nice and watery i went into of them it was so biting cold i couldnt keep it when was that the canal was frozen yes it was a few months after a pity a couple of the camerons werent there to see me squatting in the mens place meadero i tried to draw a picture of it before i tore it up like a sausage or something i wonder theyre not afraid going about of getting a kick or a bang of something there the woman is beauty of course thats admitted when he said i could pose for a picture naked to some rich fellow in holles street when he lost the job in helys and i was selling the clothes and strumming in the coffee palace would i be like that bath of the nymph with my hair down yes only shes younger or im a little like that dirty bitch in that spanish photo he has nymphs used they go about like that i asked him about her and that word met something with hoses in it and he came out with some jawbreakers about the incarnation he never can explain a thing simply the way a body can understand then he goes and burns the bottom out of the pan all for his kidney this one not so much theres the mark of his teeth still where he tried to bite the nipple i had to scream out arent they fearful trying to hurt you i had a great breast of milk with milly enough for two what was the reason of that he said i could have got a pound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning that delicate looking student that stopped in no with the citrons penrose nearly caught me washing through the window only for i snapped up the towel to my face that was his studenting hurt me they used to weaning her till he got doctor brady to give me the belladonna prescription i had to get him to suck them they were so hard he said it was sweeter and thicker than cows then he wanted to milk me into the tea well hes beyond everything i declare somebody ought to put him in the budget if i only could remember the one half of the things and write a book out of it the works of master poldy yes and its so much smoother the skin much an hour he was at them im sure by the clock like some kind of a big infant i had at me they want everything in their mouth all the pleasure those men get out of a woman i can feel his mouth o lord i must stretch myself i wished he was here or somebody to let myself go with and come again like that i feel all fire inside me or if i could dream it when he made me spend the nd time tickling me behind with his finger i was coming for about minutes with my legs round him i had to hug him after o lord i wanted to shout out all sorts of things fuck or shit or anything at all only not to look ugly or those lines from the strain who knows the way hed take it you want to feel your way with a man theyre not all like him thank god some of them want you to be so nice about it i noticed the contrast he does it and doesnt talk i gave my eyes that look with my hair a bit loose from the tumbling and my tongue between my lips up to him the savage brute thursday friday one saturday two sunday three o lord i cant wait till monday frseeeeeeeefronnnng train somewhere whistling the strength those engines have in them like big giants and the water rolling all over and out of them all sides like the end of loves old sweeeetsonnnng the poor men that have to be out all the night from their wives and families in those roasting engines stifling it was today im glad i burned the half of those old freemans and photo bits leaving things like that lying about hes getting very careless and threw the rest of them up in the w c ill get him to cut them tomorrow for me instead of having them there for the next year to get a few pence for them have him asking wheres last januarys paper and all those old overcoats i bundled out of the hall making the place hotter than it is that rain was lovely and refreshing just after my beauty sleep i thought it was going to get like gibraltar my goodness the heat there before the levanter came on black as night and the glare of the rock standing up in it like a big giant compared with their rock mountain they think is so great with the red sentries here and there the poplars and they all whitehot and the smell of the rainwater in those tanks watching the sun all the time weltering down on you faded all that lovely frock fathers friend mrs stanhope sent me from the b marche paris what a shame my dearest doggerina she wrote on it she was very nice whats this her other name was just a p c to tell you i sent the little present have just had a jolly warm bath and

matador gomez was given the bulls ear these clothes we have to wear whoever invented them expecting you to walk up killiney hill then for example at that picnic all staysed up you cant do a blessed thing in them in a crowd run or jump out of the way thats why i was afraid when that other ferocious old bull began to charge the banderilleros with the sashes and the things in their hats and the brutes of men shouting bravo toro sure the women were as bad in their nice white mantillas ripping all the whole insides out of those poor horses i never heard of such a thing in all my life yes he used to break his heart at me taking off the dog barking in bell lane poor brute and it sick what became of them ever i suppose theyre dead long ago the of them its like all through a mist makes you feel so old i made the scones of course i had everything all to myself then a girl hester we used to compare our hair mine was thicker than hers she showed me how to settle it at the back when i put it up and whats this else how to make a knot on a thread with the one hand we were like cousins what age was i then the night of the storm i slept in her bed she had her arms round me then we were fighting in the morning with the pillow what fun he was watching me whenever he got an opportunity at the band on the alameda esplanade when i was with father and captain grove i looked up at the church first and then at the windows then down and our eyes met i felt something go through me like all needles my eyes were dancing i remember after when i looked at myself in the glass hardly recognised myself the change he was attractive to a girl in spite of his being a little bald intelligent looking disappointed and gay at the same time he was like thomas in the shadow of ashlydyat i had a splendid skin from the sun and the excitement like a rose i didnt get a wink of sleep it wouldnt have been nice on account of her but i could have stopped it in time she gave me the moonstone to read that was the first i read of wilkie collins east lynne i read and the shadow of ashlydyat mrs henry wood henry dunbar by that other woman i lent him afterwards with mulveys photo in it so as he

flanders a whore always shoplifting anything she could cloth and stuff and yards of it o this blanket is too heavy on me thats better i havent even one decent nightdress this thing gets all rolled under me besides him and his fooling thats better i used to be weltering then in the heat my shift drenched with the sweat stuck in the cheeks of my bottom on the chair when i stood up they were so fattish and firm when i got up on the sofa cushions to see with my clothes up and the bugs tons of them at night and the mosquito nets i couldnt read a line lord how long ago it seems centuries of course they never came back and she didnt put her address right on it either she may have noticed her wogger people were always going away and we never i remember that day with the waves and the boats with their high heads rocking and the smell of ship those officers uniforms on shore leave made me seasick he didnt say anything he was very serious i had the high buttoned boots on and my skirt was blowing she kissed me six or seven times didnt i cry yes i believe i did or near it my lips were taittering when i said goodbye she had a gorgeous wrap of some special kind of blue colour on her for the voyage made very peculiarly to one side like and it was extremely pretty it got as dull as the devil after they went i was almost planning to run away mad out of it somewhere were never easy where we are father or aunt or marriage waiting always waiting to guiiiide him toooo me waiting nor speeeed his flying feet their damn guns bursting and booming all over the shop especially the queens birthday and throwing everything down in all directions if you didnt open the windows when general ulysses grant whoever he was or did supposed to be some great fellow landed off the ship and old sprague the consul that was there from before the flood dressed up poor man and he in mourning for the son then the same old bugles for reveille in the morning and drums rolling and the unfortunate poor devils of soldiers walking about with messtins smelling the place more than the old longbearded jews in their jellibees and levites assembly and sound clear and gunfire for the men to cross the lines and the warden marching with his keys to lock the gates and the bagpipes and only captain groves and father talking about rorkes drift and plevna and sir garnet wolseley and gordon at khartoum lighting their pipes for them everytime they went out drunken old devil with his grog on the windowsill catch him leaving any of it picking his nose trying to think of some other dirty story to tell up in a corner but he never forgot himself when i was there sending me out of the room on some blind excuse paying his compliments the bushmills whisky talking of course but hed do the same to the next woman that came along i suppose he died of galloping drink ages ago the days like years not a letter from a living soul except the odd few i posted to myself with bits of paper in them so bored sometimes i could fight with my nails listening to that old arab with the one eye and his heass of an instrument singing his heah heah aheah all my compriment on your hotchapotch of your heass as bad as now with the hands hanging off me looking out of the window if there was a nice fellow even in the opposite house that medical in holles street the nurse was after when i put on my gloves and hat

if you ask me those country gougers up in the city arms intelligence they had a damn sight less than the bulls and cows they were selling the meat and the coalmans bell that noisy bugger trying to swindle me with the wrong bill he took out of his hat what a pair of paws and pots and pans and kettles to mend any broken bottles for a poor man today and no visitors or post ever except his cheques

 mulveys was the first when i was in bed that morning and mrs rubio brought it in with the coffee she stood there standing when i asked her to hand me and i pointing at them i couldnt think of the word a hairpin to open it with ah horquilla disobliging old thing and it staring her in the face with her switch of false hair on her and vain about her appearance ugly as she was near or a her face a mass of wrinkles with all her religion domineering because she never could get over the atlantic fleet coming in half the ships of the world and the union jack flying with all her carabineros because drunken english sailors took all the rock from them and because i didnt run into mass often enough in santa maria to please her with her shawl up on her except when there was a marriage on with all her miracles of the saints and her black blessed virgin with the silver dress and the sun dancing times on easter sunday morning and when the priest was going by with the bell bringing the vatican to the dying blessing herself for his majestad an admirer he signed it i near jumped out of my skin i wanted to pick him up when i saw him following me along the calle real in the shop window then he tipped me just in passing but i never thought hed write making an appointment i had it inside my petticoat bodice all day reading it up in every hole and corner while father was up at the drill instructing to find out by the handwriting or the language of stamps singing i remember shall i wear a white rose and i wanted to put on the old stupid clock to near the time he was the first man kissed me under the moorish wall my sweetheart when a boy it never entered my head what kissing meant till he put his tongue in my mouth his mouth was sweetlike young i put my knee up to him a few times to learn the way what did i tell him i was engaged for for fun to the son of a spanish nobleman named don miguel de la flora and he believed me that i was to be married to him in years time theres many a true word spoken in jest there is a flower that bloometh a few things i told him true about myself just for him to be imagining the spanish girls he didnt like i suppose one of them wouldnt have him i got him excited he crushed all the flowers on my bosom he brought me he couldnt count the pesetas and the perragordas till i taught him cappoquin he came from he said on the black water but it was too short then the day before he left may yes it was may when the infant king of spain was born im always like that in the spring id like a new fellow every year up on the tiptop under the rockgun near oharas tower i told him it was struck by lightning and all about the old barbary apes they sent to clapham without a tail careering all over the show on each others back mrs rubio said she was a regular old rock scorpion robbing the chickens out of inces farm and throw stones at you if you went anear he was looking at me i had that white blouse on open in the front to encourage him as much as i could without too openly they were just beginning to be plump i said i was tired we lay over the firtree cove a wild place i suppose it must be the highest rock in existence the galleries and casemates and those frightful rocks and saint michaels cave with the icicles or whatever they call them hanging down and ladders all the mud plotching my boots im sure thats the way down the monkeys go under the sea to africa when they die the ships out far like chips that was the malta boat passing yes the sea and the sky you could do what you liked lie there for ever he caressed them outside they love doing that its the roundness there i was leaning over him with my white ricestraw hat to take the newness out of it the left side of my face the best my blouse open for his last day transparent kind of shirt he had i could see his chest pink he wanted to touch mine with his for a moment but i wouldnt let him he was awfully put out first for fear you never know consumption or leave me with a child embarazada that old servant ines told me that one drop even if it got into you at all after i tried with the banana but i was afraid it might break and get lost up in me somewhere because they once took something down out of a woman that was up there for years covered with limesalts theyre all mad to get in there where they come out of youd think they could never go far enough up and then theyre done with you in a way till the next time yes because theres a wonderful feeling there so tender all the time how did we finish it off yes o yes i pulled him off into my handkerchief pretending not to be excited but i opened my legs i wouldnt let him touch me inside my petticoat because i had a skirt opening up the side i tormented the life out of him first tickling him i loved rousing that dog in the hotel rrrsssstt awokwokawok his eyes shut and a bird flying below us he was shy all the same i liked him like that moaning i made him blush a little when i got over him that way when i unbuttoned him and took his out and drew back the skin it had a kind of eye in it theyre all buttons men down the middle on the wrong side of them molly darling he called me what was his name jack joe harry mulvey was it yes i think a lieutenant he was rather fair he had a laughing kind of a voice so i went round to the whatyoucallit everything was whatyoucallit moustache had he he said hed come back lord its just like yesterday to me and if i was married hed do it to me and i promised him yes faithfully id let him block me now flying perhaps hes dead or killed or a captain or admiral its nearly years if i said firtree cove he would if he came up behind me and put his hands over my eyes to guess who i might recognise him hes young still about perhaps hes married some girl on the black water and is quite changed they all do they havent half the character a woman has she little knows what i did with her beloved husband before he ever dreamt of her in broad daylight too in the sight of the whole world you might say they could have put an article about it in the chronicle i was a bit wild after when i blew out the old bag the biscuits were in from benady bros and exploded it lord what a bang all the woodcocks and pigeons screaming coming back the same way that we went over middle hill round by the old guardhouse and the jews burialplace pretending to read out the hebrew on them i wanted to fire his pistol he said he hadnt one he didnt know what to make of me with his peak cap on that he always wore crooked as often as i settled it straight h m s calypso swinging my hat that old bishop that spoke off the altar his long preach about womans higher functions about girls now riding the bicycle and wearing peak caps and the new woman bloomers god send him sense and me more money i suppose theyre called after him i never thought that would be my name bloom when i used to write it in print to see how it looked on a visiting card or practising for the butcher and oblige m bloom youre looking blooming josie used to say after i married him well its better than breen or briggs does brig or those awful names with bottom in them mrs ramsbottom or some other kind of a bottom mulvey i wouldnt go mad about either or suppose i divorced him mrs boylan my mother whoever she was might have given me a nicer name the lord knows after the lovely one she had lunita laredo the fun we had running along williss road to europa point twisting in and out all round the other side of jersey they were shaking and dancing about in my blouse like millys little ones now when she runs up the stairs i loved looking down at them i was jumping up at the pepper trees and the white poplars pulling the leaves off and throwing them at him he went to india he was to write the voyages those men have to make to the ends of the world and back its the least they might get a squeeze or two at a woman while they can going out to be drowned or blown up somewhere i went up windmill hill to the flats that sunday morning with captain rubios that was dead spyglass like the sentry had he said hed have one or two from on board i wore that frock from the b marche paris and the coral necklace the straits shining i could see over to morocco almost the bay of tangier white and the atlas mountain with snow on it and the straits like a river so clear harry molly darling i was thinking of him on the sea all the time after at mass when my petticoat began to slip down at the elevation weeks and weeks i kept the handkerchief under my pillow for the smell of him there was no decent perfume to be got in that gibraltar only that cheap peau despagne that faded and left a stink on you more than anything else i wanted to give him a memento he gave me that clumsy claddagh ring for luck that i gave gardner going to south africa where those boers killed him with their war and fever but they were well beaten all the same as if it brought its bad luck with it like an opal or pearl still it must have been pure carrot gold because it was very heavy but what could you get in a place like that the sandfrog shower from africa and that derelict ship that came up to the harbour marie the marie whatyoucallit no he hadnt a moustache that was gardner yes i can see his face cleanshaven frseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeefrong that train again weeping tone once in the dear

leather medal with a putty rim for all the plans he invents then leaving us here all day youd never know what old beggar at the door for a crust with his long story might be a tramp and put his foot in the way to prevent me shutting it like that picture of that hardened criminal he was called in lloyds weekly news years in jail then he comes out and murders an old woman for her money imagine his poor wife or mother or whoever she is such a face youd run miles away from i couldnt rest easy till i bolted all the doors and windows to make sure but its worse again being locked up like in a prison or a madhouse they ought to be all shot or the cat of nine tails a big brute like that that would attack a poor old woman to murder her in her bed id cut them off him so i would not that hed be much use still better than nothing the night i was sure i heard burglars in the kitchen and he went down in his shirt with a candle and a poker as if he was looking for a mouse as white as a sheet frightened out of his wits making as much noise as he possibly could for the burglars benefit there isnt much to steal indeed the lord knows still its the feeling especially now with milly away such an idea for him to send the girl down there to learn to take photographs on account of his grandfather instead of sending her to skerrys academy where shed have to learn not like me getting all at school only hed do a thing like that all the same on account of me and boylan thats why he did it im certain the way he plots and plans everything out i couldnt turn round with her in the place lately unless i bolted the door first gave me the fidgets coming in without knocking first when i put the chair against the door just as i was washing myself there below with the glove get on your nerves then doing the loglady all day put her in a glasscase with two at a time to look at her if he knew she broke off the hand off that little gimcrack statue with her roughness and carelessness before she left that i got that little italian boy to mend so that you cant see the join for shillings wouldnt even teem the potatoes for you of course shes right not to ruin her hands i noticed he was always talking to her lately at the table explaining things in the paper and she pretending to understand sly of course that comes from his side of the house he cant say i pretend things can he im too honest as a matter of fact and helping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with her its me shed tell not him i suppose he thinks im finished out and laid on the shelf well im not no nor anything like it well see well see now shes well on for flirting too with tom devans two sons imitating me whistling with those romps of murray girls calling for her can milly come out please shes in great demand to pick what they can out of her round in nelson street riding harry devans bicycle at night its as well he sent her where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting to go on the skatingrink and smoking their cigarettes through their nose i smelt it off her dress when i was biting off the thread of the button i sewed on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me i tell you only i oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it brings a parting and the last plumpudding too split in halves see it comes out no matter what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste your blouse is open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle blackbottom and i had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on show on the windowsill before all the people passing they all look at her like me when i was her age of course any old rag looks well on you then a great touchmenot too in her own way at the only way in the theatre royal take your foot away out of that i hate people touching me afraid of her life id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that touching must go on in theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always trying to wiggle up to you that fellow in the pit at the gaiety for beerbohm tree in trilby the last time ill ever go there to be squashed like that for any trilby or her barebum every two minutes tipping me there and looking away hes a bit daft i think i saw him after trying to get near two stylishdressed ladies outside switzers window at the same little game i recognised him on the moment the face and everything but he didnt remember me yes and she didnt even want me to kiss her at the broadstone going away well i hope shell get someone to dance attendance on her the way i did when she was down with the mumps and her glands swollen wheres this and wheres that of course she cant feel anything deep yet i never came properly till i was what or so it went into the wrong place always only the usual girls nonsense and giggling that conny connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with sealingwax though she clapped when the curtain came down because he looked so handsome then we had martin harvey for breakfast dinner and supper i thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man gives up his life for her that way for nothing i suppose there are a few men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it really happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love in their natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each other that would feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit foolish in the head his father must have been a bit queer to go and poison himself after her still poor old man i suppose he felt lost shes always making love to my things too the few old rags i have wanting to put her hair up at my powder too only ruin her skin on her shes time enough for that all her life after of course shes restless knowing shes pretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay that way i was too but theres no use going to the fair with the thing answering me like a fishwoman when i asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we met mrs joe gallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not to see us in her trap with friery the solicitor we werent grand enough till i gave her damn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that now for answering me like that and that for your impudence she had me that exasperated of course contradicting i was badtempered too because how was it there was a weed in the tea or i didnt sleep the night before cheese i ate was it and i told her over and over again not to leave knives crossed like that because she has nobody to command her as she said herself well if he doesnt correct her faith i will that was the last time she turned on the teartap i was just like that myself they darent order me about the place its his fault of course having the two of us slaving here instead of getting in a woman long ago am i ever going to have a proper servant again of course then shed see him coming id have to let her know or shed revenge it arent they a nuisance that old mrs fleming you have to be walking round after her putting the things into her hands sneezing and farting into the pots well of course shes old she cant help it a good job i found that rotten old smelly dishcloth that got lost behind the dresser i knew there was something and opened the area window to let out the smell bringing in his friends to entertain them like the night he walked home with a dog if you please that might have been mad especially simon dedalus son his father such a criticiser with his glasses up with his tall hat on him at the cricket match and a great big hole in his sock one thing laughing at the other and his son that got all those prizes for whatever he won them in the intermediate imagine climbing over the railings if anybody saw him that knew us i wonder he didnt tear a big hole in his grand funeral trousers as if the one nature gave wasnt enough for anybody hawking him down into the dirty old kitchen now is he right in his head i ask pity it wasnt washing day my old pair of drawers might have been hanging up too on the line on exhibition for all hed ever care with the ironmould mark the stupid old bundle burned on them he might think was something else and she never even rendered down the fat i told her and now shes going such as she was on account of her paralysed husband getting worse theres always something wrong with them disease or they have to go under an operation or if its not that its drink and he beats her ill have to hunt around again for someone every day i get up theres some new thing on sweet god sweet god well when im stretched out dead in my grave i suppose ill have some peace i want to get up a minute if im let wait o jesus wait yes that thing has come on me yes now wouldnt that afflict you of course all the poking and rooting and ploughing he had up in me now what am i to do friday saturday sunday wouldnt that pester the soul out of a body unless he likes it some men do god knows theres always something wrong with us days every or weeks usual monthly auction isnt it simply sickening that night it came on me like that the one and only time we were in a box that michael gunn gave him to see mrs kendal and her husband at the gaiety something he did about insurance for him in drimmies i was fit to be tied though i wouldnt give in with that gentleman of fashion staring down at me with his glasses and him the other side of me talking about spinoza and his soul thats dead i suppose millions of years ago i smiled the best i could all in a swamp leaning forward as if i was interested having to sit it out then to the last tag i wont forget that wife of scarli in a hurry supposed to be a fast play about adultery that idiot in the gallery hissing the woman adulteress he shouted i suppose he went and had a woman in the next lane running round all the back ways after to make up for it i wish he had what i had then hed boo i bet the cat itself is better off than us have we too much blood up in us or what o patience above its pouring out of me like the sea anyhow he didnt make me pregnant as big as he is i dont want to ruin the clean sheets i just put on i suppose the clean linen i wore brought it on too damn it damn it and they always want to see a stain on the bed to know youre a virgin for them all thats troubling them theyre such fools too you could be a widow or divorced times over a daub of red ink would do or blackberry juice no thats too purply o jamesy let me up out of this pooh sweets of sin whoever suggested that business for women what between clothes and cooking and children this damned old bed too jingling like the dickens i suppose they could hear us away over the other side of the park till i suggested to put the quilt on the floor with the pillow under my bottom i wonder is it nicer in the day i think it is easy i think ill cut all this hair off me there scalding me i might look like a young girl wouldnt he get the great suckin the next time he turned up my clothes on me id give anything to see his face wheres the chamber gone easy ive a holy horror of its breaking under me after that old commode i wonder was i too heavy sitting on his knee i made him sit on the easychair purposely when i took off only my blouse and skirt first in the other room he was so busy where he oughtnt to be he never felt me i hope my breath was sweet after those kissing comfits easy god i remember one time i could scout it out straight whistling like a man almost easy o lord how noisy i hope theyre bubbles on it for a wad of money from some fellow ill have to perfume it in the morning dont forget i bet he never saw a better pair of thighs than that look how white they are the smoothest place is right there between this bit here how soft like a peach easy god i wouldnt mind being a man and get up on a lovely woman o lord what a row youre making like the jersey lily easy easy o how the waters come down at lahore who knows is there anything the matter with my insides or have i something growing in me getting that thing like that every week when was it last i whit monday yes its only about weeks i ought to go to the doctor only it would be like before i married him when i had that white thing coming from me and floey made me go to that dry old stick dr collins for womens diseases on pembroke road your vagina he called it i suppose thats how he got all the gilt mirrors and carpets getting round those rich ones off stephens green running up to him for every little fiddlefaddle her vagina and her cochinchina theyve money of course so theyre all right i wouldnt marry him not if he was the last man in the world besides theres something queer about their children always smelling around those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what i did had an offensive odour what did he want me to do but the one thing gold maybe what a question if i smathered it all over his wrinkly old face for him with all my compriments i suppose hed know then and could you pass it easily pass what i thought he was talking about the rock of gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by the way only i like letting myself down after in the hole as far as i can squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and needles still theres something in it i suppose i always used to know by millys when she was a child whether she had worms or not still all the same paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and asking me had i frequent omissions where do those old fellows get all the words they have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked sideways i wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or god knows what else still i liked him when he sat down to write the thing out frowning so severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you lying strap o anything no matter who except an idiot he was clever enough to spot that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad crazy letters my precious one everything connected with your glorious body everything underlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and of joy for ever something he got out of some nonsensical book that he had me always at myself and times a day sometimes and i said i hadnt are you sure o yes i said i am quite sure in a way that shut him up i knew what was coming next only natural weakness it was he excited me i dont know how the first night ever we met when i was living in rehoboth terrace we stood staring at one another for about minutes as if we met somewhere i suppose on account of my being jewess looking after my mother he used to amuse me the things he said with the half sloothering smile on him and all the doyles said he was going to stand for a member of parliament o wasnt i the born fool to believe all his blather about home rule and the land league sending me that long strool of a song out of the huguenots to sing in french to be more classy o beau pays de la touraine that i never even sang once explaining and rigmaroling about religion and persecution he wont let you enjoy anything naturally then might he as a great favour the very st opportunity he got a chance in brighton square running into my bedroom pretending the ink got on his hands to wash it off with the albion milk and sulphur soap i used to use and the gelatine still round it o i laughed myself sick at him that day i better not make an alnight sitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a natural size so that a woman could sit on it properly he kneels down to do it i suppose there isnt in all creation another man with the habits he has look at the way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he without a hard bolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out all my teeth breathing with his hand on his nose like that indian god he took me to show one wet sunday in the museum in kildare street all yellow in a pinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and our lords both put together all over asia imitating him as hes always imitating everybody i suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big square feet up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking thing anyway wheres this those napkins are ah yes i know i hope the old press doesnt creak ah i knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time somewhere still she must have given him great value for his money of course he has to pay for it from her o this nuisance of a thing i hope theyll have something better for us in the other world tying ourselves up god help us thats all right for tonight now the lumpy old jingly bed always reminds me of old cohen i suppose he scratched himself in it often enough and he thinks father bought it from lord napier that i used to admire when i was a little girl because i told him easy piano o i like my bed god here we are as bad as ever after years how many houses were we in at all raymond terrace and ontario terrace and lombard street and holles street and he goes about whistling every time were on the run again his huguenots or the frogs march pretending to help the men with our sticks of furniture and then the city arms hotel worse and worse says warden daly that charming place on the landing always somebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them always know who was in there last every time were just getting on right something happens or he puts his big foot in it thoms and helys and mr cuffes and drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over his old lottery tickets that was to be all our salvations or he goes and gives impudence well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the freeman too like the rest on account of those sinner fein or the freemasons then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling along in the wet all by himself round by coadys lane will give him much consolation that he says is so capable and sincerely irish he is indeed judging by the sincerity of the trousers i saw on him wait theres georges church bells wait quarters the hour wait two oclock well thats a nice hour of the night for him to be coming home at to anybody climbing down into the area if anybody saw him ill knock him off that little habit tomorrow first ill look at his shirt to see or ill see if he has that french letter still in his pocketbook i suppose he thinks i dont know deceitful men all their pockets arent enough for their lies then why should we tell them even if its the truth they dont believe you then tucked up in bed like those babies in the aristocrats masterpiece he brought me another time as if we hadnt enough of that in real life without some old aristocrat or whatever his name is disgusting you more with those rotten pictures children with two heads and no legs thats the kind of villainy theyre always dreaming about with not another thing in their empty heads they ought to get slow poison the half of them then tea and toast for him buttered on both sides and newlaid eggs i suppose im nothing any more when i wouldnt let him lick me in holles street one night man man tyrant as ever for the one thing he slept on the floor half the night naked the way the jews used when somebody dies belonged to them and wouldnt eat any breakfast or speak a word wanting to be petted so i thought i stood out enough for one time and let him he does it all wrong too thinking only of his own pleasure his tongue is too flat or i dont know what he forgets that wethen i dont ill make him do it again if he doesnt mind himself and lock him down to sleep in the coalcellar with the blackbeetles i wonder was it her josie off her head with my castoffs hes such a born liar too no hed never have the courage with a married woman thats why he wants me and boylan though as for her denis as she calls him that forlornlooking spectacle you couldnt call him a husband yes its some little bitch hes got in with even when i was with him with milly at the college races that hornblower with the childs bonnet on the top of his nob let us into by the back way he was throwing his sheeps eyes at those two doing skirt duty up and down i tried to wink at him first no use of course and thats the way his money goes this is the fruits of mr paddy dignam yes they were all in great style at the grand funeral in the paper boylan brought in if they saw a real officers funeral thatd be something reversed arms muffled drums the poor horse walking behind in black l boom and tom kernan that drunken little barrelly man that bit his tongue off falling down the mens w c drunk in some place or other and martin cunningham and the two dedaluses and fanny mcoys husband white head of cabbage skinny thing with a turn in her eye trying to sing my songs shed want to be born all over again and her old green dress with the lowneck as she cant attract them any other way like dabbling on a rainy day i see it all now plainly and they call that friendship killing and then burying one another and they all with their wives and families at home more especially jack power keeping that barmaid he does of course his wife is always sick or going to be sick or just getting better of it and hes a goodlooking man still though hes getting a bit grey over the ears theyre a nice lot all of them well theyre not going to get my husband again into their clutches if i can help it making fun of him then behind his back i know well when he goes on with his idiotics because he has sense enough not to squander every penny piece he earns down their gullets and looks after his wife and family goodfornothings poor paddy dignam all the same im sorry in a way for him what are his wife and children going to do unless he was insured comical little teetotum always stuck up in some pub corner and her or her son waiting bill bailey wont you please come home her widows weeds wont improve her appearance theyre awfully becoming though if youre goodlooking what men wasnt he yes he was at the glencree dinner and ben dollard base barreltone the night he borrowed the swallowtail to sing out of in holles street squeezed and squashed into them and grinning all over his big dolly face like a wellwhipped childs botty didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough that must have been a spectacle on the stage imagine paying in the preserved seats for that to see him trotting off in his trowlers and simon dedalus too he was always turning up half screwed singing the second verse first the old love is the new was one of his so sweetly sang the maiden on the hawthorn bough he was always on for flirtyfying too when i sang maritana with him at freddy mayers private opera he had a delicious glorious voice phoebe dearest goodbye sweetheart sweetheart he always sang it not like bartell darcy sweet tart goodbye of course he had the gift of the voice so there was no art in it all over you like a warm showerbath o maritana wildwood flower we sang splendidly though it was a bit too high for my register even transposed and he was married at the time to may goulding but then hed say or do something to knock the good out of it hes a widower now i wonder what sort is his son he says hes an author and going to be a university professor of italian and im to take lessons what is he driving at now showing him my photo its not good of me i ought to have got it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion still i look young in it i wonder he didnt make him a present of it altogether and me too after all why not i saw him driving down to the kingsbridge station with his father and mother i was in mourning thats years ago now yes hed be though what was the good in going into mourning for what was neither one thing nor the other the first cry was enough for me i heard the deathwatch too ticking in the wall of course he insisted hed go into mourning for the cat i suppose hes a man now by this time he was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord fauntleroy suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when i saw him at mat dillons he liked me too i remember they all do wait by god yes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when i laid out the deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met before i thought it meant him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either besides my face was turned the other way what was the th card after that the of spades for a journey by land then there was a letter on its way and scandals too the queens and the of diamonds for a rise in society yes wait it all came out and red s for new garments look at that and didnt i dream something too yes there was something about poetry in it i hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or standing up like a red indian what do they go about like that for only getting themselves and their poetry laughed at i always liked poetry when i was a girl first i thought he was a poet like lord byron and not an ounce of it in his composition i thought he was quite different i wonder is he too young hes about wait i was married milly is yesterday what age was he then at dillons or about i suppose hes or more im not too old for him if hes or i hope hes not that stuckup university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting down in the old kitchen with him taking eppss cocoa and talking of course he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was out of trinity college hes very young to be a professor i hope hes not a professor like goodwin was he was a potent professor of john jameson they all write about some woman in their poetry well i suppose he wont find many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where poetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully coming back on the nightboat from tarifa the lighthouse at europa point the guitar that fellow played was so expressive will i ever go back there again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid ill sing that for him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly bright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young star itll be a change the lord knows to have an intelligent person to talk to about yourself not always listening to him and billy prescotts ad and keyess ad and tom the devils ad then if anything goes wrong in their business we have to suffer im sure hes very distinguished id like to meet a man like that god not those other ruck besides hes young those fine young men i could see down in margate strand bathingplace from the side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a god or something and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men like that thered be some consolation for a woman like that lovely little statue he bought i could look at him all day long curly head and his shoulders his finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and poetry for you i often felt i wanted to kiss him all over also his lovely young cock there so simple i wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth if nobody was looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and white he looks with his boyish face i would too in a minute even if some of it went down what its only like gruel or the dew theres no danger besides hed be so clean compared with those pigs of men i suppose never dream of washing it from years end to the other the most of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches im sure itll be grand if i can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age ill throw them the st thing in the morning till i see if the wishcard comes out or ill try pairing the lady herself and see if he comes out ill read and study all i can find or learn a bit off by heart if i knew who he likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the same and i can teach him the other part ill make him feel all over him till he half faints under me then hell write about me lover and mistress publicly too with our photographs in all the papers when he becomes famous o but then what am i going to do about him though no thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no nothing in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because i didnt call him hugh the ignoramus that doesnt know poetry from a cabbage thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place pulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so barefaced without even asking permission and standing out that vulgar way in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a butcher or those old hypocrites in the time of julius caesar of course hes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might as well be in bed with what with a lion god im sure hed have something better to say for himself an old lion would o well i suppose its because they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he couldnt resist they excite myself sometimes its well for men all the amount of pleasure they get off a womans body were so round and white for them always i wished i was one myself for a change just to try with that thing they have swelling up on you so hard and at the same time so soft when you touch it my uncle john has a thing long i heard those cornerboys saying passing the comer of marrowbone lane my aunt mary has a thing hairy because it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it didnt make me blush why should it either its only nature and he puts his thing long into my aunt marys hairy etcetera and turns out to be you put the handle in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick and choose what they please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl for their different tastes like those houses round behind irish street no but were to be always chained up theyre not going to be chaining me up no damn fear once i start i tell you for their stupid husbands jealousy why cant we all remain friends over it instead of quarrelling her husband found it out what they did together well naturally and if he did can he undo it hes coronado anyway whatever he does and then he going to the other mad extreme about the wife in fair tyrants of course the man never even casts a nd thought on the husband or wife either its the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we given all those desires for id like to know i cant help it if im young still can i its a wonder im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with him so cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the wrong end of me not knowing i suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a womans bottom id throw my hat at him after that hed kiss anything unnatural where we havent atom of any kind of expression in us all of us the same lumps of lard before ever id do that to a man pfooh the dirty brutes the mere thought is enough i kiss the feet of you senorita theres some sense in that didnt he kiss our halldoor yes he did what a madman nobody understands his cracked ideas but me still of course a woman wants to be embraced times a day almost to make her look young no matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the lord god i was thinking would i go around by the quays there some dark evening where nobodyd know me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not care a pin whose i was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of those wildlooking gipsies in rathfarnham had their camp pitched near the bloomfield laundry to try and steal our things if they could i only sent mine there a few times for the name model laundry sending me back over and over some old ones odd stockings that blackguardlooking fellow with the fine eyes peeling a switch attack me in the dark and ride me up against the wall without a word or a murderer anybody what they do themselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats that k c lives up somewhere this way coming out of hardwicke lane the night he gave us the fish supper on account of winning over the boxing match of course it was for me he gave it i knew him by his gaiters and the walk and when i turned round a minute after just to see there was a woman after coming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his wife after that only i suppose the half of those sailors are rotten again with disease o move over your big carcass out of that for the love of mike listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so well he may sleep and sigh the great suggester don poldo de la flora if he knew how he came out on the cards this morning hed have something to sigh for a dark man in some perplexity between s too in prison for lord knows what he does that i dont know and im to be slooching around down in the kitchen to get his lordship his breakfast while hes rolled up like a mummy will i indeed did you ever see me running id just like to see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt i dont care what anybody says itd be much better for the world to be governed by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and killing one another and slaughtering when do you ever see women rolling around drunk like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it on horses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop sure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know what it is to be a woman and a mother how could they where would they all of them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what i never had thats why i suppose hes running wild now out at night away from his books and studies and not living at home on account of the usual rowy house i suppose well its a poor case that those that have a fine son like that theyre not satisfied and i none was he not able to make one it wasnt my fault we came together when i was watching the two dogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that disheartened me altogether i suppose i oughtnt to have buried him in that little woolly jacket i knitted crying as i was but give it to some poor child but i knew well id never have another our st death too it was we were never the same since o im not going to think myself into the glooms about that any more i wonder why he wouldnt stay the night i felt all the time it was somebody strange he brought in instead of roving around the city meeting god knows who nightwalkers and pickpockets his poor mother wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining himself for life perhaps still its a lovely hour so silent i used to love coming home after dances the air of the night they have friends they can talk to weve none either he wants what he wont get or its some woman ready to stick her knife in you i hate that in women no wonder they treat us the way they do we are a dreadful lot of bitches i suppose its all the troubles we have makes us so snappy im not like that he could easy have slept in there on the sofa in the other room i suppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young hardly of me in the next room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah what harm dedalus i wonder its like those names in gibraltar delapaz delagracia they had the devils queer names there father vilaplana of santa maria that gave me the rosary rosales y oreilly in the calle las siete revueltas and pisimbo and mrs opisso in governor street o what a name id go and drown myself in the first river if i had a name like her o my and all the bits of streets paradise ramp and bedlam ramp and rodgers ramp and crutchetts ramp and the devils gap steps well small blame to me if i am a harumscarum i know i am a bit i declare to god i dont feel a day older than then i wonder could i get my tongue round any of the spanish como esta usted muy bien gracias y usted see i havent forgotten it all i thought i had only for the grammar a noun is the name of any person place or thing pity i never tried to read that novel cantankerous mrs rubio lent me by valera with the questions in it all upside down the two ways i always knew wed go away in the end i can tell him the spanish and he tell me the italian then hell see im not so ignorant what a pity he didnt stay im sure the poor fellow was dead tired and wanted a good sleep badly i could have brought him in his breakfast in bed with a bit of toast so long as i didnt do it on the knife for bad luck or if the woman was going her rounds with the watercress and something nice and tasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might like i never could bear the look of them in abrines i could do the criada the room looks all right since i changed it the other way you see something was telling me all the time id have to introduce myself not knowing me from adam very funny wouldnt it im his wife or pretend we were in spain with him half awake without a gods notion where he is dos huevos estrellados senor lord the cracked things come into my head sometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed with us why not theres the room upstairs empty and millys bed in the back room he could do his writing and studies at the table in there for all the scribbling he does at it and if he wants to read in bed in the morning like me as hes making the breakfast for he can make it for im sure im not going to take in lodgers off the street for him if he takes a gesabo of a house like this id love to have a long talk with an intelligent welleducated person id have to get a nice pair of red slippers like those turks with the fez used to sell or yellow and a nice semitransparent morning gown that i badly want or a peachblossom dressing jacket like the one long ago in walpoles only or ill just give him one more chance ill get up early in the morning im sick of cohens old bed in any case i might go over to the markets to see all the vegetables and cabbages and tomatoes and carrots and all kinds of splendid fruits all coming in lovely and fresh who knows whod be the st man id meet theyre out looking for it in the morning mamy dillon used to say they are and the night too that was her massgoing id love a big juicy pear now to melt in your mouth like when i used to be in the longing way then ill throw him up his eggs and tea in the moustachecup she gave him to make his mouth bigger i suppose hed like my nice cream too i know what ill do ill go about rather gay not too much singing a bit now and then mi fa pieta masetto then ill start dressing myself to go out presto non son piu forte ill put on my best shift and drawers let him have a good eyeful out of that to make his micky stand for him ill let him know if thats what he wanted that his wife is fucked yes and damn well fucked too up to my neck nearly not by him or times handrunning theres the mark of his spunk on the clean sheet i wouldnt bother to even iron it out that ought to satisfy him if you dont believe me feel my belly unless i made him stand there and put him into me ive a mind to tell him every scrap and make him do it out in front of me serve him right its all his own fault if i am an adulteress as the thing in the gallery said o much about it if thats all the harm ever we did in this vale of tears god knows its not much doesnt everybody only they hide it i suppose thats what a woman is supposed to be there for or he wouldnt have made us the way he did so attractive to men then if he wants to kiss my bottom ill drag open my drawers and bulge it right out in his face as large as life he can stick his tongue miles up my hole as hes there my brown part then ill tell him i want or perhaps ill tell him i want to buy underclothes then if he gives me that well he wont be too bad i dont want to soak it all out of him like other women do i could often have written out a fine cheque for myself and write his name on it for a couple of pounds a few times he forgot to lock it up besides he wont spend it ill let him do it off on me behind provided he doesnt smear all my good drawers o i suppose that cant be helped ill do the indifferent or questions ill know by the answers when hes like that he cant keep a thing back i know every turn in him ill tighten my bottom well and let out a few smutty words smellrump or lick my shit or the first mad thing comes into my head then ill suggest about yes o wait now sonny my turn is coming ill be quite gay and friendly over it o but i was forgetting this bloody pest of a thing pfooh you wouldnt know which to laugh or cry were such a mixture of plum and apple no ill have to wear the old things so much the better itll be more pointed hell never know whether he did it or not there thats good enough for you any old thing at all then ill wipe him off me just like a business his omission then ill go out ill have him eying up at the ceiling where is she gone now make him want me thats the only way a quarter after what an unearthly hour i suppose theyre just getting up in china now combing out their pigtails for the day well soon have the nuns ringing the angelus theyve nobody coming in to spoil their sleep except an odd priest or two for his night office or the alarmclock next door at cockshout clattering the brains out of itself let me see if i can doze off what kind of flowers are those they invented like the stars the wallpaper in lombard street was much nicer the apron he gave me was like that something only i only wore it twice better lower this lamp and try again so as i can get up early ill go to lambes there beside findlaters and get them to send us some flowers to put about the place in case he brings him home tomorrow today i mean no no fridays an unlucky day first i want to do the place up someway the dust grows in it i think while im asleep then we can have music and cigarettes i can accompany him first i must clean the keys of the piano with milk whatll i wear shall i wear a white rose or those fairy cakes in liptons i love the smell of a rich big shop at d a lb or the other ones with the cherries in them and the pinky sugar d a couple of lbs of those a nice plant for the middle of the table id get that cheaper in wait wheres this i saw them not long ago i love flowers id love to have the whole place swimming in roses god of heaven theres nothing like nature the wild mountains then the sea and the waves rushing then the beautiful country with the fields of oats and wheat and all kinds of things and all the fine cattle going about that would do your heart good to see rivers and lakes and flowers all sorts of shapes and smells and colours springing up even out of the ditches primroses and violets nature it is as for them saying theres no god i wouldnt give a snap of my two fingers for all their learning why dont they go and create something i often asked him atheists or whatever they call themselves go and wash the cobbles off themselves first then they go howling for the priest and they dying and why why because theyre afraid of hell on account of their bad conscience ah yes i know them well who was the first person in the universe before there was anybody that made it all who ah that they dont know neither do i so there you are they might as well try to stop the sun from rising tomorrow the sun shines for you he said the day we were lying among the rhododendrons on howth head in the grey tweed suit and his straw hat the day i got him to propose to me yes first i gave him the bit of seedcake out of my mouth and it was leapyear like now yes years ago my god after that long kiss i near lost my breath yes he said i was a flower of the mountain yes so we are flowers all a womans body yes that was one true thing he said in his life and the sun shines for you today yes that was why i liked him because i saw he understood or felt what a woman is and i knew i could always get round him and i gave him all the pleasure i could leading him on till he asked me to say yes and i wouldnt answer first only looked out over the sea and the sky i was thinking of so many things he didnt know of mulvey and mr stanhope and hester and father and old captain groves and the sailors playing all birds fly and i say stoop and washing up dishes they called it on the pier and the sentry in front of the governors house with the thing round his white helmet poor devil half roasted and the spanish girls laughing in their shawls and their tall combs and the auctions in the morning the greeks and the jews and the arabs and the devil knows who else from all the ends of europe and duke street and the fowl market all clucking outside larby sharons and the poor donkeys slipping half asleep and the vague fellows in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the steps and the big wheels of the carts of the bulls and the old castle thousands of years old yes and those handsome moors all in white and turbans like kings asking you to sit down in their little bit of a shop and ronda with the old windows of the posadas glancing eyes a lattice hid for her lover to kiss the iron and the wineshops half open at night and the castanets and the night we missed the boat at algeciras the watchman going about serene with his lamp and o that awful deepdown torrent o and the sea the sea crimson sometimes like fire and the glorious sunsets and the figtrees in the alameda gardens yes and all the queer little streets and the pink and blue and yellow houses and the rosegardens and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and gibraltar as a girl where i was a flower of the mountain yes when i put the rose in my hair like the andalusian girls used or shall i wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the moorish wall and i thought well as well him as another and then i asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would i yes to say yes my mountain flower and first i put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes i said yes i will yes          1.0028769753553985
