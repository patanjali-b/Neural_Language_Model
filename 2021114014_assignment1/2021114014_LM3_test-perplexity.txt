 darcy      40.180045871559635
 upon the whole i am much pleased with him      230.93272565288527
 how unlucky      40.180045871559635
as a child she was affectionate and pleasing and extremely fond of me and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement      862.7562342018396
 bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister that they did not once sit down to a family dinner      372.45003409638105
 after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room from the sideboard to the fender to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london mr      132.3813837378881
 you have done all this      40.18004587155964
 on sunday after morning service the separation so agreeable to almost all took place      131.31759116025418
 she shared in their attendance on mrs      1427.975929389808
 collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect that the sight of such rooms so many servants and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them      361.81223398768026
 it has been a very agreeable day said miss bennet to elizabeth      652.6545479576013
 and there was my aunt all the time i was dressing preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon      245.70747261763321
 and gravely glancing at mr      46.84069723043458
 chapter viii      593.2512678456395
 darcy were by no means over      112.01184380426061
 remember eliza that he does not know janes disposition as you do      3959.427936662425
 could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydias note to his wife      98.57191120788451
 and i have another favour to ask      48.25136662857857
 catherine and lydia had information for them of a different sort      308.0182548170025
i am excessively attentive to all those things      661.1328189185259
 hurst had a house      40.180045871559635
 they must all go to brighton      149.14775414202964
 mrs      40.180045871559635
 so tall      2055.0826751266004
 if it were merely a fine house richly furnished said she i should not care about it myself but the grounds are delightful      586.9329334482131
 the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage explained to her that by his wife at least if not by himself such a hope was cherished      147.44661158454915
 what is your own opinion      196.76366340203643
 no she would go home      193.8822165604934
 darcy who sat opposite to them      112.01184380426061
 he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while      420.55038898135825
 darcy handed the ladies into the carriage and when it drove off elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house      127.60860787471151
 in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty and while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper go to your father he wants you in the library      587.5600822317351
 elizabeth listened wondered doubted and was impatient for more      638.3453683233403
 if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it      310.67637212925797
 it is a pity they are not handsome      141.05631401884585
 pray go to see them with sir william and maria      95.29731477998538
 all      40.180045871559635
 i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much deference      188.5206453552472
 i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies      173.18632755843475
 bingley since you went away said mrs      409.634838160385
 i congratulate her      47.69655374366655
 hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep      211.4458388133046
 is it not clear enough      266.8786023171327
 every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world and every body began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness      310.1542655044267
 elizabeth turned away to hide a smile      457.06455567466907
 bennet who could by no means wish for so speedy a return immediately said but is there not danger of lady catherines disapprobation here my good sir      373.97348433058204
 from the entrance hall of which mr      312.2265164829214
 this was very amiable but charlottes kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception ofits object was nothing less than to secure her from any return of mr      532.5869103112882
 darcy you see is the man      112.01184380426061
 elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyships entrance though no request of introduction had been made      324.61513845262994
 i am going tomorrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him      197.08453111563983
 mr      40.180045871559635
 edw      40.180045871559635
 how long has she been such a favourite      98.53406417097078
 my child let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life      320.4885315461015
 darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching pemberley and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning      221.26378022245288
 their fortune on both sides is splendid      133.0953620989658
 no hatred had vanished long ago and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him that could be so called      114.01324436082474
 elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane on their first arrival at lambton and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there but on the third her repining was over and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere      229.27393411187788
 well thensupposing them to be in london      344.7260227396972
 however little mr      40.18004587155963
 they found mary as usual deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature and had some new extracts to admire and some new observations of threadbare morality to listen to      312.5640460068682
 elizabeth to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this heard it in silent indignation      264.9645655935216
 indeed you must go for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not      246.9574500567002
 wickham of course wanted more than he could get but at length was reduced to be reasonable      460.13475055110354
 lizzy said he i was going to look for you come into my room      147.72547470278545
 upon my word caroline i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation      201.98107012194967
 darcy      40.180045871559635
 when you told mrs      1728.1116545639725
 lydia my love ring the bell      47.22482128665673
 and as i come back i can call on lady lucas and mrs      251.92187681472458
 and so is it quite certain he is coming      118.3115828354352
 he could not speak a word for full ten minutes      151.22369713892485
 wickham will soon be gone and therefore it will not signify to anybody here what he really is      331.13490048006145
 if he fears me why come hither      336.0379407954306
 we were always good friends and now we are better      1872.3035643548149
 long has just been here and she told me all about it      87.42885498049806
 lizzy is not a bit better than the others and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane nor half so good humoured as lydia      182.3425466955087
 one ought not to repinebut to be sure it would have been such a thing for me      63.833394880050655
 their party in the diningroom was large for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news and various were the subjects which occupied them lady lucas was enquiring of maria across the table after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter mrs      166.06856524308586
 the vicious propensitiesthe want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments which mr      571.673934830589
 elizabeth was excessively disappointed she had set her heart on seeing the lakes and still thought there might have been time enough      1527.3204528048755
 you have only proved by this cried elizabeth that mr      95.29731477998538
 some acquaintance or other my dear i suppose i am sure i do not know      343.53921206315806
 and to be kept back on such a motive      104.89508377878933
 if he did shrug his shoulders it was not till sir william was out of sight      179.44519939979182
 i did not think caroline in spirits were her words but she was very glad to see me and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london      116.59377418455327
 much more rational my dear caroline i dare say but it would not be near so much like a ball      189.69542685251238
 and mrs      50.44002045615935
 it must be something particular to take him there at this time of year      764.8193830784621
 it is a nice long walk and mr      141.05631401884585
 darcy and their niece directed their observation towards each with an earnest though guarded enquiry and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love      245.4621821931397
 oh      40.180045871559635
 he was then he said on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after her      492.99073814311606
 nor was it under many many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them      243.15807863465284
 if you were sensible of your own good you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up      886.5175661248745
 the world has been deceived in that respect and i am happy to say there will be some little money even when all his debts are discharged to settle on my niece in addition to her own fortune      319.3584778355487
 there is i believe in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil a natural defect which not even the best education can overcome      620.8750541210078
 what is to become of us      150.99265483593226
 as for their mother mr      949.4507627218111
 regard for my sisters credit and feelings prevented any public exposure but i wrote to mr      276.44430788350627
 elizabeth was disgusted and even miss bennet was shocked      638.3453683233403
 so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper or her affectionate heart      124.57408811586751
 the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited      176.080353188451
 you shall hear thenbut prepare yourself for something very dreadful      102.137133032156
 when tea was over mr      814.4408058503984
 she then sat still five minutes longer but unable to waste such a precious occasion she suddenly got up and saying to kitty come here my love i want to speak to you took her out of the room      406.5593839321147
 darcy mentioned his letter      48.67170741604832
 but so they always are      193.88221656049342
 i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty elegance and accomplishments and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister      89.14594814744373
 bennet regretted that their stay would be so short and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter and having very frequent parties at home      341.92456507738655
 collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune which charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next day      277.6588851471665
 from that moment i observed my friends behaviour attentively and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him      471.4826743903552
 mr      40.180045871559635
 i never saw any one so shocked      409.63483816038496
 but he found in reply to this question that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country      176.47604093735515
it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man      299.9431901637956
 kitty has no discretion in her coughs said her father she times them ill      81.16693512866163
you ought all to have learned      40.18004587155962
 darcy was punctual in his return and as lydia informed you attended the wedding      355.61055115241373
 conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible      279.751202685194
 gardiner but perhaps to the lakes      48.7256596060145
 was not a man to be trusted      424.67726616915616
 i remain dear sir with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters your wellwisher and friend william collins      284.7441666123652
 his attachment to rosings certainly increases      196.76519440418363
 let me do it without farther loss of time      553.6343247770378
i shall certainly try to get the better      137.5326105540385
 she represented to him all the improprieties of lydias general behaviour the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs      678.5762544259383
 that is the most unforgiving speech said elizabeth that i ever heard you utter      249.81189284928604
 my youngest sister has left all her friendshas elopedhas thrown herself into the power ofof mr      529.194508315491
 this was a lucky recollectionit saved her from something like regret      428.5558681332657
 let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers      214.1995210579994
 it was a large wellproportioned room handsomely fitted up      280.0695696317507
 do not distress me by the idea      40.18004587155962
 she looks sickly and cross      1074.6610861758516
 she was wild to be at hometo hear to see to be upon the spot to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her in a family so deranged a father absent a mother incapable of exertion and requiring constant attendance and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia her uncles interference seemed of the utmost importance and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience was severe      399.0431749827963
 after playing some italian songs miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air and soon afterwards mr      517.8925446366723
 proud that in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better of himself      92.08267893188538
 but i was embarrassed      287.3557310311285
 she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs      392.4085058910766
 gardiner that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her      84.12159213636347
 will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again      75.53066147949649
 i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable unless you truly esteemed your husband unless you looked up to him as a superior      131.18488235357813
 what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant      656.6786855550732
 elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation      638.3453683233403
 they are all for what they can get      118.26281776226949
my good opinion once lost is lost for ever      96.32698225303865
 when the teathings were removed and the card tables placed the ladies all rose and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her mothers rapacity for whist players and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party      477.01765866602113
 wickhams intention to go into the regulars and among his former friends there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army      173.92926638713612
 my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology      95.29731477998538
 it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing said bingley      526.6895249235397
 having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs      46.32795517412836
 mr      40.180045871559635
 bennets consent should be asked in the course of the evening      1221.0715293689334
 with no greater events than these in the longbourn family and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton sometimes dirty and sometimes cold did january and february pass away      196.87208930186554
 elizabeth obeyed and running into her own room for her parasol attended her noble guest down stairs      696.5791539440303
 nothing child nothing      40.18004587155963
 the one missent must be first attended to it had been written five days ago      1061.935578356204
miss bennets lovely face confirmed his views and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority and for the first evening she was his settled choice      1176.0824096657084
 her reflections were in general satisfactory      149.14775414202964
 he readily assured her of his secrecyagain expressed his sorrow for her distress wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope and leaving his compliments for her relations with only one serious parting look went away      489.5312869304316
 for the truth of every thing here related i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam who from our near relationship and constant intimacy and still more as one of the executors of my fathers will has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions      189.4975450494052
 our situation with regard to lady catherines family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast      94.90268234081327
 but when they had withdrawn he said to her mrs      397.373361834421
 bennets visit and sat about ten minutes with him in his library      1179.5901277391422
 while these newlyborn notions were passing in their heads the perturbation of elizabeths feelings was every moment increasing      848.7516759766087
 if therefore an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days she added i shall know how to understand it      623.2999808389053
 instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend as elizabeth half expected mr      682.5622630728883
 a few weeks he believed      826.5448963094074
 i shall not say that you are mistaken he replied because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own      304.1197388935366
 it was a subject which they could not mention before me      413.9638745652505
 i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very welland indeed so i do still at my heart and if a smart young colonel with five or six thousand a year should want one of my girls i shall not say nay to him and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir williams in his regimentals      529.6958673979979
 my real purpose was to see you and to judge if i could whether i might ever hope to make you love me      683.603678251593
 reynolds either from pride or attachment had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister      354.03248888997007
 if i may so express it he has a right to be proud      268.86487230773906
 gardiner would have been highly gratified by her nieces beginning the subject      156.64098766324358
 collins arrived on tuesday addressed to their father and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonths abode in the family might have prompted      190.7620630958424
said jane faintly smilingyou must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation i could not hesitate      339.408353516131
 my dear sir replied mr      193.88221656049342
 cried his wife impatiently      170.20775607060068
 wickham when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which if true must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition      536.6832097966604
 his arrival was soon known at the parsonage for mr      113.20604203762944
 on this subject and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsfordbetween our pools at quadrille while mrs      263.94495773751476
 philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other of whom however she could only tell her nieces what they already knew that mr      777.9354910668635
 a low phaeton with a nice little pair of ponies would be the very thing      205.0585702385527
 darcy in any thing and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives      65.94949243936607
 collinss admiration      593.2512678456395
 well now let us be quite comfortable and snug and talk and laugh all the way home      390.3825098472571
 and so ended his affection said elizabeth impatiently      128.96651725653706
 it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match      241.04129999526884
 darcy by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room and then though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate she began to regret that he came      521.1141011309451
 my dear lizzy where can you have been walking to      209.33624878614827
 if i had known as much this morning i certainly would not have called on him      105.56434917977317
 you began the evening well charlotte said mrs      287.3557310311285
 bennet before breakfast a conversation beginning with his parsonagehouse and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes that a mistress for it might be found at longbourn produced from her amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement a caution against the very jane he had fixed on      562.2337225114137
 mr      40.180045871559635
 i must conclude for i cannot be long from my poor mother      404.63592953573004
 elizabeth looked surprised      553.6343247770379
 without supposing them from what she saw to be very seriously in love their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment      545.6694797767478
 as for the gentleman himself his feelings were chiefly expressed not by embarrassment or dejection or by trying to avoid her but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence      620.0403568592897
 mrs      40.180045871559635
 robinson did not i mention it to you      334.1775935511654
 the horses were post and neither the carriage nor the livery of the servant who preceded it were familiar to them      1251.3587653364905
 your uncle is as much surprised as i amand nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done      337.71728375402614
 said elizabeth to herself      456.35026821455256
 annesley to miss darcy had been given to remind her of her post      276.3583358806745
 darcy however should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman or the insolent smiles of the ladies were more intolerable      218.59906327915047
 i now give it to you if you are resolved on having him      142.57741727478316
 wickham undoubtedly by design for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs      363.70063793207385
 in the gallery there were many family portraits but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger      139.47000155407915
 but will they make you happy      493.2321102623554
 collins you must send a servant with them      224.6212925920574
 the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return mr      312.83247147737404
 could i expect it to be otherwise      86.71128887110011
 pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of cried colonel fitzwilliam      402.03946222499604
 could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts      78.76213679687508
 she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt who did call on him in her return through london and there relate her journey to longbourn its motive and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which in her ladyships apprehension peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which she had refused to give      320.60158645956676
 collinss making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted      240.05339859293005
 they had all been very illused since she last saw her sister      87.96792383940962
 bennet      40.180045871559635
my fathers opinion of me does me the greatest honour and i should be miserable to forfeit it      380.15391724848945
 charles when you build your house i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley      422.0752946773569
 your sister i also watched      40.18004587155964
 such a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but gratitudefor to love ardent love it must be attributed and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged as by no means unpleasing though it could not be exactly defined      327.08863001624195
 repeated miss bingley      553.6343247770378
 it would have spared her she thought one sleepless night out of two      77.01170556009085
 her daughter miss de bourgh will have a very large fortune and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates      404.84722635916654
 bennet had no more to say and lady lucas who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken      165.5715985491402
 every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter and in farther justification of mr      187.3899171156621
 i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one      236.20571918551522
 lizzy you must not do so      43.777273982465275
 the officers may not be so pleasant in general s regiment      933.7295034289098
 philips was an amiable intelligent elegant woman and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces      575.9680434157177
 i must find mr      326.7964217101449
 collins you must marry      154.39191415161193
 i ask only a comfortable home and considering mr      119.95778435034282
 let me congratulate you on a very important conquest      1007.0510981986496
 as soon as they were gone elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits or in other words to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more      510.9604504468056
 if you do not choose to understand me forgive my impertinence      75.90735072936485
 bingley returned mr      630.5159359353626
 in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mothers words or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr      177.28370218345205
 and when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether mr      329.24268394185356
 why will you think so      168.78427283983868
 as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family the ceremony of leavetaking was performed when the ladies moved for the night and mrs      305.1404901286282
 collins have a comfortable income but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeysand i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance      415.27792668852925
 cried mrs      593.2512678456395
 mr      40.180045871559635
 darcythat mr      40.180045871559635
 it was generally evident whenever they met that he did admire her and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first and was in a way to be very much in love but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general since jane united with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent      273.7586732239501
 with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted      418.35187744147714
 the wisest and the best of men nay the wisest and best of their actions may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke      976.3720421064883
 but jane knows as well as i do what wickham really is      158.99083955424658
 i suppose you have heard of it indeed you must have seen it in the papers      529.194508315491
 mrs      40.180045871559635
 cried elizabeth i am excessively diverted      398.65549376437934
 gardiner declared his willingness and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation      165.95534549319623
 mr      40.180045871559635
 but let me advise you to think better of it      425.89422393296474
 gardiner      40.180045871559635
 and have you answered the letter      45.65845347891731
 you certainly do she replied with a smile but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome      130.65547168208383
 this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence and the little value he put on his own good qualities      68.2479018424108
 bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday and in her postscript it was added that if mr      553.6343247770379
 i owe all that i know of it to another not to you      141.07561508561136
 he did every thing best in the world and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of september than any body else in the country      221.10657400495856
 her astonishment at his comingat his coming to netherfield to longbourn and voluntarily seeking her again was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire      316.84939870777526
 mr      40.180045871559635
 they were hopeless of remedy      193.8822165604934
 his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn      243.133162693239
 it may be easily believed that however little of novelty could be added to their fears hopes and conjectures on this interesting subject by its repeated discussion no other could detain them from it long during the whole of the journey      441.5844199303874
 it was not all settled before monday as soon as it was the express was sent off to longbourn      243.318811288558
 it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way      281.0087404752878
 mrs      40.180045871559635
 elizabeths spirits soon rising to playfulness again she wanted mr      484.1179473929701
 miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy      2442.4545342577603
 i can hardly write for laughing      122.04000939110638
 upon my honour i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as i have this evening and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty      266.8588420281149
 darcy speaking to her      48.67170741604832
 mary however continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them      352.85895063750064
 how much you must have gone through      344.7260227396972
 philips the lucases and all their other neighbours and to hear herself called mrs      430.42652562066166
 with a renewal of tenderness however they repaired to her room on leaving the diningparlour and sat with her till summoned to coffee      303.3133547989995
 bennets emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort for it gratified him he said to discover that charlotte lucas whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible was as foolish as his wife and more foolish than his daughter      477.9024409160369
 good heaven      40.180045871559635
 darcy it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings where they were engaged to drink tea      222.25937135581535
 bennet alarmed      2055.0826751266004
 after watching her a little fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful      369.30213888984446
 he smiled looked handsome and said many pretty things      1517.8674094465453
 to no creature had it been revealed where secresy was possible except to elizabeth and from all bingleys connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him of their becoming hereafter her own      468.2341764831311
 he will be forgot and we shall all be as we were before      734.8605318308602
 she was afraid of talking longer of his friend and having nothing else to say was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him      233.15679845941216
 four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister      969.126814479653
 gardiner i begin to be of your uncles opinion      111.0658790719945
 she is a great deal too ill to be moved      556.1054897948459
 every body said how well she looked and mr      553.6343247770379
 would you believe it lizzy that when he went to town last november he really loved me and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again      139.0326711520895
 it was more than civil it was really attentive and there was no necessity for such attention      288.7270551932204
 lady catherine has been of infinite use which ought to make her happy for she loves to be of use      204.06174286472108
 mr      40.180045871559635
 the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a secret      147.72547470278545
 she saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at present unknown      1705.6997158489683
i assure you i feel it exceedingly said lady catherine i believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as i do      346.092490621531
 but when she read and reread with the closest attention the particulars immediately following of wickhams resigning all pretensions to the living of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds again was she forced to hesitate      328.92283488195216
 on applying to see the place they were admitted into the hall and elizabeth as they waited for the housekeeper had leisure to wonder at her being where she was      429.55159891808694
 and mrs      50.44002045615935
 you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles for you are wasting your time with me      219.30211835237526
 mr      40.180045871559635
we have tried two or three subjects already without success and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine      260.3537912635445
 but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede      73.60471559840194
 miss bennet replied her ladyship in an angry tone you ought to know that i am not to be trifled with      1314.198178049627
 but his anger i am persuaded lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sisters sentiments      249.99720020996097
 on both sides it was only assertion      123.66431352908175
 bennet and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom      455.04617964930196
 and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice      251.47375157036467
 how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it      73.6388833326172
 darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot      218.26321496923586
 it is settled between us already that we are to be the happiest couple in the world      744.6233582004581
he left netherfield for london on the day following as you i am certain remember with the design of soon returning      677.0154855833227
 i know you will do him such ample justice that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent      90.28036763435416
 and with regard to the resentment of his family or the indignation of the world if the former were excited by his marrying me it would not give me one moments concernand the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn      324.38045215304516
 the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlottes situation and his expectation of a young olivebranch      495.47746857836387
 mr      40.180045871559635
 dear me      40.180045871559635
 in the next room is a new instrument just come down for hera present from my master she comes here tomorrow with him      175.9463293917319
 can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand      643.81738264433
 miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard      568.0469798899188
 he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world      513.4716584611726
 i grieve to find however that colonel f      122.20038525283768
 i promised them so faithfully      214.89381683922795
 a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other and out of their three months acquaintance they had been intimate two      384.11140296101416
 they all paint tables cover skreens and net purses      104.89508377878933
 a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it      223.74883008742097
 collins did i tell you of lady metcalfes calling yesterday to thank me      127.15014621521995
 she is a most charming young lady indeed      974.5649638737762
 when she did come it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it she made a slight formal apology for not calling before said not a word of wishing to see me again and was in every respect so altered a creature that when she went away i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer      354.22786393411684
 but i cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london      113.47746133900053
 he now wished it more than ever      344.7260227396972
 they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas and mr      104.89508377878933
 darcy she could not but allow that mr      231.82233938585148
 the coach therefore took them the first stage of their journey and brought its master back to longbourn      405.85396495830247
 indeed jane you ought to believe me      409.63483816038496
 it convinced her that accident only could discover to mr      76.30307162803409
 breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth my dearest lizzy i find myself very unwell this morning which i suppose is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday      871.1706497805753
 i will not trust myself on the subject replied wickham i can hardly be just to him      107.73859446875196
 gardiner soon wrote again to his brother      48.25136662857857
 she answered with equal indifference and brevity and the other said no more      1698.8623869002495
 i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me      964.8702372352931
 this is a parade cried he which does one good it gives such an elegance to misfortune      337.78295887694594
 she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight and was certain of a willing listener in jane whenever she might wish to talk again of either      276.75474673194026
 while mary is adjusting her ideas he continued let us return to mr      266.3050534095758
 at length the chaise arrived the trunks were fastened on the parcels placed within and it was pronounced to be ready      264.8736937103124
 i am sure i know none so handsome but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer larger picture of him than this      293.4145509831932
 lady catherines unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts      188.3200190496311
do not wish me such an evil      40.18004587155962
 wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth and she was very willing to hear him though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told the history of his acquaintance with mr      475.4176428035049
perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones      883.2263801266133
every savage can dance      2055.0826751266004
 perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation      561.3226536237387
 it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man      131.7012394023751
 the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth      444.7741157611596
 i wish i could say for the sake of her family that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible amiable wellinformed woman for the rest of her life though perhaps it was lucky for her husband who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly      369.4317528118637
 gardiner had hurried back in alarm supposing by the servants account that their niece was taken suddenly illbut satisfying them instantly on that head she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons reading the two letters aloud and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy      228.76608411753404
 i shall then give over every expectation every wish of his constancy      175.8235638616876
 we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured      702.7288573860191
 wickham he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them and a ball was at any rate a ball      466.8079470820437
 who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after your arrival      189.16861013607092
 bennet very dull for several days      2055.0826751265995
 here are officers enough at meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country      717.7035001951501
 i have met with two instances lately one i will not mention the other is charlottes marriage      273.1056739857487
 bingley her sisters being in town      162.50061330981657
 but mrs      2055.0826751266004
 it would not be easy indeed to catch their expression but their colour and shape and the eyelashes so remarkably fine might be copied      223.10799123286498
 the paling of rosings park was their boundary on one side      188.79457117739554
 i might as well enquire replied she why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will against your reason and even against your character      519.4553543498618
 it became her turn to listen      603.1999465440327
 i have not that pain      48.77556424151038
how humiliating is this discovery      168.78427283983865
 i write rather slowly      274.801939533802
 they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world      1601.5402070088783
 there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley that could provoke his ridicule or disgust him into silence and he was more communicative and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him      420.03271539404625
 mrs      40.180045871559635
 not yet however in spite of her disappointment in her husband did mrs      234.17466463324809
but these i suppose are precisely what you are without      1002.6942481228496
 hurst merely looked the gentleman but his friend mr      597.9581442605057
 but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley      513.4990390659351
 true and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room      88.10151354178245
 could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment after such an affront to colonel forster      482.2508627507904
 my dear lizzy you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now      124.96692465141132
 pray do my dear miss lucas she added in a melancholy tone for nobody is on my side nobody takes part with me i am cruelly used nobody feels for my poor nerves      485.824258192118
 we were born in the same parish within the same park the greatest part of our youth was passed together inmates of the same house sharing the same amusements objects of the same parental care      796.9995910243819
 then taking the disengaged arm of mr      123.66431352908175
he was to come there with wickham you know      602.8790430468292
 darcy had much better finish his letter      96.75118673458583
 chapter v      593.2512678456395
 it was the prospect of constant society and good society he added which was my chief inducement to enter the shire      785.981947057978
 it was too early in the morning for visitors and besides the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours      125.36608833834269
 and how impossible in others      46.84069723043458
 she longed to see mrs      1074.6610861758516
 i never heard that it was      162.50061330981654
 the express was sent off directly      553.6343247770379
 we shall often meet i hope in hertfordshire      845.7804792087704
 it was a fortnight since mrs      156.17263829396418
 society i own is necessary to me      976.0372292447908
 the feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten      656.2508837723714
 wickham will never marry a woman without some money      448.43438601158647
 such an openness and gentleness in his manner      252.80405370482077
 he was on one side of her mother      845.7804792087704
 it is unaccountable      47.69655374366655
 what is there of good to be expected      309.28076086829844
 the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time and the plan became perfect as plan could be      772.5696610893
 but do not be cast down      149.14775414202964
 in as short a time as mr      163.9637590071433
 said she as she looked in her face      401.0875241865695
 he bore it however with admirable calmness      380.60838679737986
 charlotte the wife of mr      137.50378397418595
does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister that she is perfectly convinced of her brothers indifference and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means most kindly      334.40555719825824
 bingley to see you all after him so soon for if i recollect right he went but the day before      305.2409867330704
 and it was not wholly without foundation      48.25136662857857
 a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth but at last on mrs      301.7512795646389
 darcy changed colour but the emotion was short and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued      154.23236014400408
 mr      40.180045871559635
 collins much offended laid aside his book and said i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp though written solely for their benefit      353.6306870743584
 he sat down for a few moments and then getting up walked about the room      314.3746124108098
 collins she thought with equal certainty and with considerable though not equal pleasure      432.59006150992326
 no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there      243.84128356646067
 darcy to me pray that i should be afraid of him      143.7375782504781
 you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them      142.21879782253163
 certainly cried his faithful assistant no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with      295.05968191592973
 you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters consequently that she is aunt to the present mr      181.9048442057183
 yes madam said mrs      2055.0826751266004
 how can they suit each other      325.97763243125945
 she does not yet leave her dressingroom      420.2257286792934
 he has also brotherly pride which with some brotherly affection makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers      341.34135998506343
 i beg your pardonone knows exactly what to think      244.51809615043015
 darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sisters refusal must have given him      230.18782687376486
 gardiner though seldom able to indulge the taste was very fond of fishing and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water and talking to the man about them that he advanced but little      166.72388223646854
 the gardiners staid a week at longbourn and what with the philipses the lucases and the officers there was not a day without its engagement      311.9800451807479
 here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse      563.2833638166594
 i knew it myself as it was known to miss bingley but her brother is even yet ignorant of it      644.2832488565882
 into one house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance      86.10265845900142
 mrs      40.180045871559635
 darcys next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it and he first called in gracechurchstreet the evening before i came home      632.3706832355919
 and if i had not a letter to write myself i might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing as another young lady once did      100.07567260402014
 she had never perceived while the regiment was in hertfordshire that lydia had any partiality for him but she was convinced that lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body      542.1938762719144
 you must learn some of my philosophy      123.66431352908175
 collins by janes introduction of him      105.19369418518376
 we will go round the park every day      689.1214946619698
 gardiner though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause could not avoid recommending moderation to her as well in her hopes as her fears and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper who attended in the absence of her daughters      250.61720694827474
 but how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue she could easily conjecture      369.9132924935907
 but what said she after a pause can have been his motive      318.1530213785297
 darcy was fixed in astonishment      137.50378397418595
 if it was not allowable for him to gain my affections because i had no money what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about and who was equally poor      215.295926096529
 you know sister we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it      236.49544503409007
 such a disappointment      697.5355397309248
 dont keep coughing so kitty for heavens sake      107.45215890937834
 darcy in a most infamous manner      112.01184380426061
 this was agreed to and mrs      182.40077126726604
 darcy though she had not before known its extent agreed equally well with his own words      100.78530882214889
 how he lived i know not      132.8755429786447
 as a brother a landlord a master she considered how many peoples happiness were in his guardianship      192.1351065889794
 depend upon it my dear that when there are twenty i will visit them all      339.059413650147
 she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged      232.76119178910503
 an express came at twelve last night just as we were all gone to bed from colonel forster to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers to own the truth with wickham      482.2217926503087
 denny addressed them directly and entreated permission to introduce his friend mr      158.99083955424658
 had his character been known this could not have happened      184.23506175176863
 he is as fine a fellow said mr      353.7272630356327
 very true indeedand now my dear jane what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business      236.01908564601572
 when all this was resolved on he returned again to his friends who were still staying at pemberley but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place and all money matters were then to receive the last finish      287.53363389332293
 had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place      82.52185040326506
 but now it was all too natural      123.66431352908175
 lydias thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter and of course i could not rest till i knew the particulars      522.6912763537808
 impossible mr      48.833743468926066
 darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my fathers active superintendance and when immediately before my fathers death mr      246.27686141195568
 mr      40.180045871559635
 you deserve no such attention      40.18004587155964
 mr      40.180045871559635
 true said mr      40.18004587155963
 when her mother went up to her dressingroom at night she followed her and made the important communication      512.5960211653082
 jamess sir william was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow and take his seat without saying a word and his daughter frightened almost out of her senses sat on the edge of her chair not knowing which way to look      658.3239649033612
 they lagged behind while elizabeth kitty and darcy were to entertain each other      143.0280457097355
 elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude but said nothing      386.0858116106476
 in revolving lady catherines expressions however she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference      107.80124785067737
 he is also handsome replied elizabeth which a young man ought likewise to be if he possibly can      290.4538174623367
 and do you really love him quite well enough      43.753984391013056
 what do you mean hill      196.76366340203643
 for herself she was humbled but she was proud of him      659.8138460137153
 they attacked him in various ways with barefaced questions ingenious suppositions and distant surmises but he eluded the skill of them all and they were at last obliged to accept the secondhand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas      225.78337182202944
 is it true      657.20306568285
 it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy      638.3453683233403
 darcy had considerable patronage in the church and his cousin could have none at all      154.18984026354863
 i know you do and it is that which makes the wonder      76.26879473641215
 i must think your language too strong in speaking of both replied jane and i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together      108.67233940393164
 so imprudent a match on both sides      1391.9868509025507
 if he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare he determined to make enquiries there and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach      176.6660081607092
 did you on reading it give any credit to its contents      42.1038898404124
 gardiner then rallied her niece on wickhams desertion and complimented her on bearing it so well      116.41154184157499
 the evening conversation when they were all assembled had lost much of its animation and almost all its sense by the absence of jane and elizabeth      247.03827437754433
 and mrs      50.44002045615935
 i believe she didand i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object      555.6263188519231
 two offences of a very different nature and by no means of equal magnitude you last night laid to my charge      885.471083199629
 jane looked well and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them      192.25789540956305
 i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good      214.89381683922795
 never mind miss lizzys hair      935.5468139228121
 bingley and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made her perhaps almost as happy as jane      138.89030151948444
 it only shews her being deficient in something herselfsense or feeling      91.70286916885189
 wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her with the promise of balls and young men her father would never consent to her going      306.5441227857022
 bennet with more perseverance than politeness protested he must be entirely mistaken and lydia always unguarded and often uncivil boisterously exclaimed good lord      1257.923457388343
 he had never before supposed that could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement      959.771120502158
 how abominable      40.180045871559635
how could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance which she had been obliged to give in the other      219.11454416066886
 darcy only entered the room      137.50378397418595
 darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sisters proficiency      494.04776321000736
 they were therefore to go      193.8822165604934
 the supposition did not pain her      553.6343247770379
 in darcys presence she dared not mention wickhams name but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moments distress but exerting herself vigorously to repel the illnatured attack she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone      537.2598244196784
 in three volumes      47.69655374366655
 i never saw such capacity and taste and application and elegance as you describe united      631.5260892325406
 my father and mother believe the worst but i cannot think so ill of him      195.79845410215648
 i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction and nobody but a governess can give it      130.50812046091502
 four nieces of mrs      203.1911860249286
 he must write his own sermons and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties and the care and improvement of his dwelling which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible      490.9381247725903
 she blushed and jane blushed but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour      332.52884516541206
 mrs      40.180045871559635
 what could he mean      270.73523260594266
 collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love for mrs      316.667405757616
 it could not be for society as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips and when he did speak it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choicea sacrifice to propriety not a pleasure to himself      359.7408900621057
 but though every thing seemed neat and comfortable she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion      252.7805434333968
do you think it incredible that mr      40.18004587155962
 wickham were and that he had seen and talked with them both wickham repeatedly lydia once      685.7162435261865
 for my part i am inclined to believe it all mr      324.8174278060367
 i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression      382.73058509084626
 did mr      40.180045871559635
 yesthe handsomest young lady that ever was seen and so accomplished      392.4085058910765
 i should take him even on my slight acquaintance to be an illtempered man      142.39545533922833
 it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single      338.75071747886255
 without allowing herself time for consideration and scarcely knowing what she felt elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the other and opening it with the utmost impatience read as follows it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first      328.52694221143605
 yes and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement      142.39545533922833
 an easy distance do you call it      473.8486766370694
 the park paling was still the boundary on one side and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground      299.19468137972666
 lady catherine might see him in her way through town and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way      223.07199017063712
 in short i will do my best      146.9491936120871
the situation of your mothers family though objectionable was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformly betrayed by herself by your three younger sisters and occasionally even by your father      230.57204567396272
 it does not necessarily follow that a deep intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours      577.2147761960922
 not these two or three years perhaps      40.18004587155962
 can i have the carriage      137.50378397418595
 london printed for t      40.180045871559635
 collins allowed him time to speak replied with an air of distant civility      129.6433717174205
 miss darcy though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations readily obeyed      233.2894487225752
 bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to be civil also and say what the occasion required      868.5264243374285
 they had nothing to accuse him of but pride pride he probably had and if not it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small markettown where the family did not visit      185.37092414565677
 a great deal more passed at the other table      114.22530160921906
 darcy      40.180045871559635
 gardiner had seen pemberley and known the late mr      111.0658790719945
 he danced only four dances though gentlemen were scarce and to my certain knowledge more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner      258.5224363628633
 it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless and who was actually staying in his colonels family that i am strongly inclined to hope the best      219.00450079933623
will you hear it      274.801939533802
 his wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind      346.73506946443763
 gardiner with occasional help from elizabeth the conversation was carried on      177.26505864357833
 i must confess myself surprised by your application i did not expect it from you      1386.302282102173
 were it certain that lady catherine would think so said mr      1128.028757021472
 but no such recollection befriended her      149.14775414202964
 you must write again very soon and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last      230.7802200120194
 gardiner looked at her niece with a smile but elizabeth could not return it      77.24617874667467
 my manners must have been in fault but not intentionally i assure you      927.391242261676
 let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivor      397.373361834421
 they were soon gone again rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs      233.41638288055955
 in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable and jane to make her resigned      79.20328513489225
 jamess had made him courteous      1090.6325292892247
 he immediately offered to fetch her others all that his library afforded      643.0084480439857
 but there were two or three much uglier in the shop and when i have bought some prettiercoloured satin to trim it with fresh i think it will be very tolerable      486.4664851715399
 were it for nothing but his love of you i must always have esteemed him but now as bingleys friend and your husband there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me      204.0085962771499
 you may imagine what i felt and how i acted      99.088346516443
 darcys farther notice though often standing within a very short distance of her quite disengaged he never came near enough to speak      291.56633515544786
 after sitting for a moment in silence she said very stiffly to elizabeth i hope you are well miss bennet      195.54925324895632
 she repeated      2055.0826751266004
 is this thought elizabeth meant for me      155.3709950043428
 bingley to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time without the ceremony of a formal invitation      338.9221806376308
 i expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter      497.1696445194923
 darcys but you shall do as you chuse      252.80405370482077
 younger sons cannot marry where they like      123.66431352908175
she felt that janes feelings though fervent were little displayed and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner not often united with great sensibility      683.696182582913
 bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet it came from netherfield and the servant waited for an answer      1020.2746251785042
 i think she will be pleased with the hermitage      45.04654393144745
 she wanted to talk but there seemed an embargo on every subject      590.1717166892623
 bingley for his kindness to jane with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy      187.75459297648928
 mrs      40.180045871559635
 i was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married but that you that miss elizabeth bennet would in all likelihood be soon afterwards united to my nephew my own nephew mr      146.574269490419
 bingleys friend without being heard by either of them      586.2036689485498
 i was never more annoyed      204.89145704742344
 bennet was quite disconcerted      2055.0826751266004
 we must trespass a little longer on your kindness      1327.273840053501
 it is wonderfulreplied wickhamfor almost all his actions may be traced to prideand pride has often been his best friend      418.35187744147714
 remember that she is one of a large family that as to fortune it is a most eligible match and be ready to believe for every bodys sake that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin      666.8441439104505
 a house in town      48.67170741604832
 we can all begin freelya slight preference is natural enough but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement      485.46468386606017
 can you come tomorrow      187.02114221103605
 on finding mrs      40.18004587155963
 bingley for his sister      326.7964217101449
 bennet treasured up the hint and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces      249.20537001439067
 let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility      413.1328768384849
 bingley does not know the whole of his history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr      190.52997802168838
 in her kind schemes for elizabeth she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam      79.66717946279196
 he should be particularly happy at any time c      249.4211393703438
 from elizabeths thoughts it was never absent      960.9565392200552
 but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of lydias leaving home      395.9023600783246
 well well and so mr      814.4408058503984
so much ease with such perfect good breeding      614.2648639237647
 they were ignorant idle and vain      149.14775414202964
 it is natural that obligation should be felt and if i could feel gratitude i would now thank you      75.13423171717184
 it was owing to him to his reserve and want of proper consideration that wickhams character had been so misunderstood and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was      320.74805711764543
 sir william had been delighted with him      433.1114096578947
 allow me by the way to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer      545.3066134157342
 she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance mrs      555.5342437275845
i am sure we never read the same or not with the same feelings      731.7200078122431
 yes but intricate characters are the most amusing      838.0179671992186
 collins instead      593.2512678456395
but i will not torment you with vain wishes which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks      98.14079921985325
 amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind the few minutes in which they continued together were some of the most uncomfortable of her life      236.2731017851634
 his brotherinlaw mr      45.75973362712816
 i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady      164.93836845405858
 your first position is false      40.18004587155964
and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail      126.03518956101894
 bingley by a housemaid and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters      247.9715366040865
 i never meant to deceive you but my spirits might often lead me wrong      417.08824389761577
 bennet and nothing can clear mr      2055.0826751265995
 elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening but she was seated between charlotte and miss de bourghthe former of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time      602.9248759491317
 but they did pass away and mr      123.66431352908175
 i should never be happy without him so think it no harm to be off      210.13672383094107
 the rooms were lofty and handsome and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor but elizabeth saw with admiration of his taste that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine with less of splendor and more real elegance than the furniture of rosings      288.345278037962
 i have nothing either to hope or fear and nothing to reproach him with      80.13758864104048
 she then ran gaily off rejoicing as she rambled about in the hope of being at home again in a day or two      222.01731598530765
 in meryton they parted the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers wives and elizabeth continued her walk alone crossing field after field at a quick pace jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity and finding herself at last within view of the house with weary ancles dirty stockings and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise      229.44431475655816
 your tempers are by no means unlike      40.18004587155962
 she was gone directly      2443.918939179379
 it is impossible for me to be impartial      139.91965378004835
 if indeed it should be so      140.5238237748651
 she was very equal therefore to address mr      2261.842575912005
 nay when i read a letter of his i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my soninlaw      209.9550333460981
 i am exceedingly gratified said bingley by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper      241.14761938071405
 lizzy why am i thus singled from my family and blessed above them all      128.97093358437337
 much as i abominate writing i would not give up mr      328.0520976776964
 bingley of course returned with him to dinner and in the evening mrs      349.50381731868526
 with the officers      500.44082999325417
 rendered spiritless by the illsuccess of all their endeavours he had yielded to his brotherinlaws intreaty that he would return to his family and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit      1033.1277889022217
 elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the diningparlour for common use it was a better sized room and had a pleasanter aspect but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did for mr      217.46714822737297
 and lydia used to want to go to london added kitty      48.40379614753852
 and her neighbours at lucas lodge therefore for through their communication with the collinses the report she concluded had reached lady catherine had only set that down as almost certain and immediate which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time      289.5208970409859
 never since reading janes second letter had she entertained a hope of wickhams meaning to marry her      626.8979800908332
 but now it comes out      193.88221656049342
 it is such a spur to ones genius such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind      308.0431123125
 persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth this was not the best method of recommending herself but angry people are not always wise and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled she had all the success she expected      552.351573393905
 we will know where we have gonewe will recollect what we have seen      401.1526929777818
 you have a sweet room here mr      42.87745007053815
 he must be an oddity i think said she      597.9581442605058
 his pride said miss lucas does not offend me so much as pride often does because there is an excuse for it      633.7766436447336
 jamess with very decent composure      1090.6325292892247
 i have no reason i assure you said he to be dissatisfied with my reception      222.25006969600912
 dear lizzy only consider what he must have suffered      111.06587907199449
 the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable but elizabeth less clearsighted perhaps in his case than in charlottes did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence      199.50046504141594
 i am only ashamed of his asking so little      111.0658790719945
 chapter x      593.2512678456395
 i am afraid he has been very imprudent and has deserved to lose mr      142.07891296464393
 oh lord      40.180045871559635
 bennet withdrew to the library she saw mr      768.4658641998429
 his marriage was now fast approaching and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable and even repeatedly to say in an illnatured tone that she wished they might be happy      511.1575064341119
 darcy with him and sat down again by her sister      160.38593678689838
 forgive the questionare you quite certain that you can be happy with him      230.97802033628398
 she listened most attentively to all that passed between them and gloried in every expression every sentence of her uncle which marked his intelligence his taste or his good manners      484.6209872426491
 these are conditions which considering every thing i had no hesitation in complying with as far as i thought myself privileged for you      440.7964851366883
 she wrote cheerfully seemed surrounded with comforts and mentioned nothing which she could not praise      1339.561396857946
 but i must tell you how it went off      244.51809615043015
 it would have been strange if they had      105.07880155417514
 oh      40.180045871559635
 elizabeth said nothing but it gratified her exceedingly the compliment must be all for herself      407.0506032403416
 he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man he certainly admired her and his situation in life was most eligible but to counterbalance these advantages mr      689.9479399910573
 but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice      343.8324909400824
 darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult to understand      636.3547757048344
 this is quite shocking      44.29607265504951
 why could not he keep on quarrelling with you as his father did before him      92.8285095284978
 mrs      40.180045871559635
 elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister for while he was present jane had no attention to bestow on any one else but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur      266.1219525289082
 at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr      428.20288677797447
 let me advise you then my dear sir to console yourself as much as possible to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence      287.46422533473117
 gardiner could not be seen and mr      48.25136662857857
 bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that instead of spending his whole income he had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of his children and of his wife if she survived him      504.4144644538668
 elizabeth could not but be pleased could not but triumph      484.1179473929701
 chapter ix      593.2512678456395
 it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure because on such occasions it is the etiquette but no one was less likely than mrs      589.9758091297393
 they have some of the finest woods in the country      209.33624878614827
 elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement but was too much oppressed to make any reply      482.10176944956197
 that is capital added her sister and they both laughed heartily      167.18823779027036
 how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you      218.37632569195978
 stop me whilst you can      1074.6610861758516
 but there was much to be talked of in marrying her and the goodnatured wishes for her welldoing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances because with such an husband her misery was considered certain      295.5027049652064
 jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be though in a quieter way      665.6378637888029
 bennet      40.180045871559635
 she supposed if he meant any thing he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter      1780.3057954221524
 jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again      232.43420395847602
 no no you shall not deceive me      40.18004587155962
 his misfortunes      40.180045871559635
 bennet before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter let us come to a right understanding      477.76414673058287
 she was at least free from the offence of mr      1132.9948875660325
 bennet you are wanted immediately we are all in an uproar      343.63187999762215
 bingley is most unaffectedly modest      214.89381683922795
 but if i were you i would stand by the nephew      312.3330508793323
 she practises very constantly      2443.918939179379
 the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely more i think than last year      190.52548863430752
 but i can assure you she added that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy for he is a most disagreeable horrid man not at all worth pleasing      330.933371807166
 but lizzy this must go no farther than yourself or jane at most      76.5759759120682
 gardiner with their four children did at length appear at longbourn      177.26505864357833
 in three volumes      47.69655374366655
 oh      40.180045871559635
miss darcy the daughter of mr      2821.0508612659632
 he has not an illnatured look      160.89343611218888
 certainly not at first      1104.1650250512666
 her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical      287.3557310311285
 if we make haste said lydia as they walked along perhaps we may see something of captain carter before he goes      907.6546774958363
 she had instinctively turned away but stopping on his approach received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome      305.30329307595974
 in future i hope we shall be always of one mind      155.23089954754917
 she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened it was impossible to think of any thing else and totally indisposed for employment she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise      343.9755732282701
 darcy said nothing at all      137.50378397418595
 well but now for my news it is about dear wickham too good for the waiter is not it      416.76353718003713
 that lady i suppose is your mother      44.83230697795726
 bingley from this time was of course a daily visitor at longbourn coming frequently before breakfast and always remaining till after supper unless when some barbarous neighbour who could not be enough detested had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept      357.9465099069289
 good gracious      40.180045871559635
 oh      40.180045871559635
 but what is that to me      493.2321102623554
 of what are you talking      617.2307109347638
 he promises fairly and i hope among different people where they may each have a character to preserve they will both be more prudent      443.8088550918702
 perhaps he must if he sees enough of her      1561.0452471586614
 convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingleys dislike of her had originated in jealousy she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her and was curious to know with how much civility on that ladys side the acquaintance would now be renewed      514.1004705941589
 when the party broke up lydia returned with mrs      512.5960211653082
 if youll believe me i did not once put my foot out of doors though i was there a fortnight      620.045570465882
and yet how many things have happened      137.9828306835864
 oh      40.180045871559635
 elizabeth was not comfortable that was impossible but she was flattered and pleased      490.2718550874355
 as that was the case neither jane to whom i related the whole nor i thought it necessary to make our knowledge public for of what use could it apparently be to any one that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown      348.3268800793014
 darcy had been at her sisters wedding      96.75118673458583
 how you must have hated me after that evening      89.1867169790351
 and as to laughter we will not expose ourselves if you please by attempting to laugh without a subject      107.69476744051629
 and so was i      48.67170741604832
 dear dear lizzy      553.6343247770378
 philips appears to do so much credit tobut he gave up every thing to be of use to the late mr      668.1777221423384
 i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more      140.277413985418
 she dared not relate the other half of mr      651.1453818168019
 now lizzy i think i have surprised you      105.07880155417514
 there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name      274.7964108064574
 yesthat is what makes it amusing      621.4335182036106
 elizabeth silently attended her      316.79232971233176
 darcy while viewing the place instantly occurred      96.75118673458583
 does your charge give you much trouble      420.2257286792934
 hang kitty      40.180045871559635
 my avowed one or what i avowed to myself was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley and if she were to make the confession to him which i have since made      198.00105613255016
 wickham we are brother and sister you know      606.26146804359
 oh      40.180045871559635
 his words seemed to imply it      603.1999465440327
 wickhams adieus were much more affectionate than his wifes      1075.0692341435515
 mrs      40.180045871559635
 mr      40.180045871559635
 but these things happen so often      149.14775414202964
 collins      40.180045871559635
 mr      40.180045871559635
but she had chosen it with her eyes open and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go she did not seem to ask for compassion      309.12228587090806
 oh      40.180045871559635
 oh brother how kind you are      149.14775414202964
 the house furniture neighbourhood and roads were all to her taste and lady catherines behaviour was most friendly and obliging      284.79991099120355
 bingley and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity for he was discovered to be proud to be above his company and above being pleased and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding disagreeable countenance and being unworthy to be compared with his friend      181.4227669370834
 he has some friends though perhaps not so many as he deserves      1276.3012762280475
 pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice which on every other subject shall be my constant guide though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself      202.42638842571742
 i do not believe mrs      44.53447856792308
 mrs      40.180045871559635
 it was rather small but well built and convenient and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit      359.86085773027526
 for my own part she rejoined i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her      332.4192524442978
 all loveliness and goodness as she is      44.83230697795726
 ah      40.180045871559635
 cried miss bingley charles writes in the most careless way imaginable      1340.8021272640933
 that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side too was another very welcome surprise for his chief wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible      186.37468116525642
 in spite of what her sister declared and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it      548.0755971903378
 a man who had felt less might      153.9592225123044
 he had followed them purposely to town he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise and where he was reduced to meet frequently meet reason with persuade and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to avoid and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce      290.60478078472056
 from herself to janefrom jane to bingley her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that mr      520.0905260069864
 she coloured as she spoke but neither that nor any thing else awakened a suspicion of the truth      543.5254213605007
 collins was gratified and with a more smiling solemnity replied it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably      253.40891947029786
 my father bears it better      709.0119023044136
 darcy to marry your daughter but would my giving you the wishedfor promise make their marriage at all more probable      84.1630762968614
 the gentleman experienced some change of feeling he drew back his chair took a newspaper from the table and glancing over it said in a colder voice are you pleased with kent      967.161457897632
 hurst and miss bingley and the lady with whom she lived in london      155.45675665146442
 there was no help for it however      380.60838679737986
 you are joking lizzy      40.180045871559635
 he drew a chair near her      149.14775414202964
 not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded unless mr      879.2387837833661
 and what is fifty miles of good road      114.79175069930865
 be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy      383.50550632847654
 well i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr      581.4491001638896
 after abusing you so abominably to your face i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations      307.50084293020086
 she shook her head      2443.918939179379
 and when we do return it shall not be like other travellers without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing      216.41118497002012
 merely to the illustration of your character said she endeavouring to shake off her gravity      327.62760880570517
 has she any family      348.08556739282983
why should he have it more than anybody else      230.93272565288527
 there is not a bit of fish to be got today      383.5055063284765
 collins i think      241.8220653663459
 she really looked almost wild      1074.6610861758516
 they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others for who as lady catherine herself condescendingly says will connect themselves with such a family      339.34061572319416
 darcy is not to be laughed at      96.75118673458583
 gardiner who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth gave her a look expressive of her wonder      266.1167358309527
 to fortune i am perfectly indifferent and shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well aware that it could not be complied with and that one thousand pounds in the per cents      414.8530194180791
 the person of whom i speak is a gentleman and a stranger      586.5551348717996
 she was overpowered by shame and vexation      1250.0599414634326
 how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr      149.13928827447236
 she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it but she could no longer be blind to miss bingleys inattention      525.1254906909311
 never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting      292.301379869648
 as she had heard no carriage she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine and under that apprehension was putting away her halffinished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions when the door opened and to her very great surprise mr      192.1406813582068
 mr      40.180045871559635
 she cried      2055.0826751266004
 her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr      333.53194055520635
 seriously i would have you be on your guard      683.8236029345476
 but however that shant prevent my asking him to dine here i am determined      362.22315691025756
 it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane said she      998.0966356108767
 elizabeth could bear it no longer      175.29785946932188
 you are not going to be missish i hope and pretend to be affronted at an idle report      66.80293493461072
 i do not pretend to regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire except your society my dearest friend but we will hope at some future period to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence      152.09945667625394
 who are your uncles and aunts      143.33975598954368
 on that head therefore i shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married      236.66475766800193
 he owed a good deal in the town but his debts of honour were still more formidable      161.81074588429814
 the two youngest of the family catherine and lydia were particularly frequent in these attentions their minds were more vacant than their sisters and when nothing better offered a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening and however bare of news the country in general might be they always contrived to learn some from their aunt      268.0916257073633
 i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble my dear sister      198.25115284165744
 do you really think so      40.18004587155964
 collins was at leisure to look around him and admire and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification but when mrs      188.564699214986
 the collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave and if you are not kind to us brother i do not know what we shall do      251.44934393494765
 it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations      188.30133511001503
 reynolds replied that he was adding but we expect him tomorrow with a large party of friends      436.564653477543
 you write uncommonly fast      40.180045871559635
 i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister      105.88871204007629
 jane then took it from her pocketbook and gave it to elizabeth      158.99083955424658
do you draw      40.18004587155963
 the rector of a parish has much to do      420.0625657963017
 this son was to join in cutting off the entail as soon as he should be of age and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for      151.155855037142
 which will not be yours till after your mothers decease is all that you may ever be entitled to      274.42351166605874
 you have sense and we all expect you to use it      180.16802150494325
but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment      170.72296720831412
 his reception however was of the most flattering kind      1151.66139456306
 lizzy my dear run down to your father and ask him how much he will give her      109.35041034301064
 we must not make him desperate      1830.870520942707
 that tall proud man      45.01868873802178
 there is nothing he would not do for her      586.2036689485498
 our plain manner of living our small rooms and few domestics and the little we see of the world must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly      283.8597441869041
 sir william only smiled      388.628629855134
oh      40.180045871559635
 you do not blame me however for refusing him      40.18004587155963
 you excel so much in the dance miss eliza that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general he can have no objection i am sure to oblige us for one half hour      370.8082889312054
 the moment of her release from him was ecstacy      1327.273840053501
 there has been many a one i fancy overcome in the same way      927.391242261676
 but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonishand perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else      360.08517430077524
 lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement she sent him language so very abusive especially of elizabeth that for some time all intercourse was at an end      215.6594953348561
 as i did the other day said elizabeth with a conscious smile very true it will be wise in me to refrain from that      123.06444282956043
 can there be any other opinion on the subject      190.80231226199865
against staying longer however elizabeth was positively resolvednor did she much expect it would be asked and fearful on the contrary as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long she urged jane to borrow mr      220.71830243922304
 he looked serious as usual and she thought more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire than as she had seen him at pemberley      397.609630843861
 the children two girls of six and eight years old and two younger boys were to be left under the particular care of their cousin jane who was the general favourite and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every wayteaching them playing with them and loving them      169.36895219551832
 with a book he was regardless of time and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations      465.1417321253042
 darcy so bad as thisthough i have never liked him i had not thought so very ill of himi had supposed him to be despising his fellowcreatures in general but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge such injustice such inhumanity as this      205.29778061966627
 wickhams society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family      810.9314796343124
it was an animating subject and mrs      457.06455567466907
 the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished that of mrs      303.26034432338963
 i shall be back by dinner      196.76519440418363
 when after examining the mother in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr      640.1215948964546
 oh      40.180045871559635
 mr      40.180045871559635
 i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere      84.25728066465443
 you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night      506.25319793730506
 collinss happiness and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too      326.9606907591861
 that he should even speak to her was amazing      104.89508377878933
 darcy contradict it      46.75775439756597
 darcybut let me not interrupt you sir      297.77639201565546
 oh      40.180045871559635
 he then handed her in maria followed and the door was on the point of being closed when he suddenly reminded them with some consternation that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings      210.88773482914306
 elizabeth hesitated but her knees trembled under her and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them      569.7891741511933
 i thought i should have broke my heart      42.84884727021275
 while she spoke an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened complexion earnestly looking at her and his sister overcome with confusion and unable to lift up her eyes      280.9268111243983
 collins was first introduced to her notice but he certainly has not known her long      500.7294782330188
 an union of a different tendency and precluding the possibility of the other was soon to be formed in their family      166.7170186160777
 she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind      838.1243936089998
 observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat he suddenly addressed her with i hope mr      775.6116118060019
poor eliza      2055.0826751266004
 care of him      281.40975190660856
 but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation she made no answer      664.65397155315
 i never met with anybody who delighted me so much      448.3784402440109
 the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a skreen      372.85892341323455
 we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us said mrs      248.4049591570447
 the present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary nothing therefore could be fairly conjectured from that though elizabeth who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings was perfectly aware that had she known nothing of darcy she could have borne the dread of lydias infamy somewhat better      424.743698642668
 it is too long ago      48.14821680567037
 but what does he say of the living      278.921710666924
 elizabeth was surprised however that wickham should consent to such a scheme and had she consulted only her own inclination any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes      775.5982818864907
 i hope he will overlook it      162.50061330981654
 i told mrs      47.69655374366655
 elizabeth asked questions in vain maria would tell her nothing more and down they ran into the diningroom which fronted the lane in quest of this wonder it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate      289.5540119234457
 there was certainly at this moment in elizabeths mind a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance      237.1772035169358
 yes very well      553.6343247770378
 his being such a charming young man and so rich and living but three miles from them were the first points of selfgratulation and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do      166.8411602948918
 i am sure i shant get a wink of sleep all night      349.9439491745609
 oh      40.180045871559635
 you take delight in vexing me      40.18004587155962
 mr      40.180045871559635
 i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude or allow her to hear it from any one but myself      78.05529889144306
 oh      40.180045871559635
 she is a great fool for going away if she liked him      358.89388335658714
 you refuse then to oblige me      40.18004587155962
 he likes to have his own way very well replied colonel fitzwilliam      317.7787403829334
 end of vol      553.6343247770379
 perhaps other people have said so before but not one with such justice      927.391242261676
 the conduct of neither if strictly examined will be irreproachable but since then we have both i hope improved in civility      198.11826691909295
 it is from my cousin mr      177.04892358567017
 when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer i made a point of her having two men servants go with her      454.98193828436905
 her mind was less difficult to develope      402.4214240998908
 his understanding and temper though unlike her own would have answered all her wishes      262.49150482591403
 had his own happiness however been the only sacrifice he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best but her sisters was involved in it as she thought he must be sensible himself      684.7532521590857
 yes my youngest is not sixteen      2306.752308967709
 i should say one of her ladyships carriages for she has several      181.4965322117328
he declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sisters attachmentand she could not help remembering what charlottes opinion had always been      571.39996722137
 mr      40.180045871559635
 lady catherine hesitated for a moment and then replied the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind      225.3984417000086
 the lucases are very artful people indeed sister      210.6309601087449
 this is a wretched beginning indeed      182.40077126726604
 in this perturbed state of mind with thoughts that could rest on nothing she walked on but it would not do in half a minute the letter was unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she could she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence      237.62567741690262
 there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer and i have enquired of every body too who is likely to know      240.53936949507036
 you are to understand miss bennet that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose nor will i be dissuaded from it      157.14320359781436
 she tried to recollect some instance of goodness some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence that might rescue him from the attacks of mr      340.99040064670424
 even elizabeth began to fearnot that bingley was indifferentbut that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away      780.6013483584096
 jane will be quite an old maid soon i declare      205.6290218907164
 every body was surprised and darcy after looking at her for a moment turned silently away      492.99073814311606
 caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter      300.7187928748232
of neither darcy nor wickham could she think without feeling that she had been blind partial prejudiced absurd      199.98597618053807
 to all the objections i have already urged i have still another to add      130.62753168947665
 follies and nonsense whims and inconsistencies do divert me i own and i laugh at them whenever i can      340.93999943746167
 there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed      210.13672383094104
 bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication      781.9447490256046
 chapter xii      593.2512678456395
 our distress my dear lizzy is very great      114.58924563402608
 darcy that she would not trust herself with an answer and therefore abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage      136.24180408594313
lady catherine was a tall large woman with stronglymarked features which might once have been handsome      267.7651760620209
 collins very gravelybut i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you      178.05597041655503
 collins who was complimenting mr      117.95102708262057
 bingley and under your orders      214.89381683922795
