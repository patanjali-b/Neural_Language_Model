 darcy          365.59090909090907
 i never can be thankful mr          353.1841735811449
 no replied jane i have not forgotten him but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you          229.75750136730082
 darcy          365.59090909090907
 but elizabeth who had not the least inclination to remain with them laughingly answered no no stay where you are          374.41812192892417
 this was exactly as it should be for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming          411.4170376276319
they had several children          757.5740872997123
 his complexion became pale with anger and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature          1065.4313440018163
 it was dated from rosings at eight oclock in the morning and was as follows be not alarmed madam on receiving this letter by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you          674.4591102962357
 kitty owned that she had rather stay at home          638.7571333521556
 good gracious          8289.50374597645
 gardiner looking at the picture it is a handsome face          440.4361237634009
 i might as well enquire replied she why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will against your reason and even against your character          428.13392403564626
 elizabeth was surprised but said not a word          51.9146589408448
 i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield          92.3068461106303
 darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham you must be very happy          117.1676049651229
 my dearest sister now be be serious          550.7523207872089
 the sight of miss lucas was odious to her          326.8397973694267
 the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to mr          317.8945311939642
 chapter xiii          38665.93187807582
 we are speaking of music madam said he when no longer able to avoid a reply          307.43093624113067
 bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them on their first coming to london before they procured lodgings          396.6627071775358
 her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town and by that means as i told lady catherine myself one day has deprived the british court of its brightest ornament          1133.6918593888274
 true          4979.0
 she shared in their attendance on mrs          764.6064619166824
 the miss webbs all play and their father has not so good an income as yours          581.4674491175276
mr          194.34758364312268
 so imprudent a match on both sides          1257.4839037521067
 collins and the convenient distance of hunsford from london          470.4418744660944
 laugh as much as you chuse but you will not laugh me out of my opinion          130.85660653472416
 mr          194.34758364312268
 as i did the other day said elizabeth with a conscious smile very true it will be wise in me to refrain from that          337.1751092190524
 the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into could not be easily overcome nor could she for many hours learn to think of it less than incessantly          505.9754728796811
 her keenest attention was awakened she longed to hear more and was grateful to her uncle for saying there are very few people of whom so much can be said          286.9948090385605
 and his behaviour so strikingly alteredwhat could it mean          1075.1688658255177
 she looked at jane and smiled and shook her head by turns          326.82075531291815
 but she would not be secure          113.6505071362396
 their manners are not equal to his          261.2535681599789
 i hoped to find you reasonable but depend upon it i will carry my point          412.7042128293275
 but she is nothing to me now          158.98055639629374
 of mr          79.33831064769187
 mrs          525.4221105527638
 the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart and by a manoeuvre of mrs          277.62164104015005
 she explained what its effect on her had been and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed          545.0733648827522
 i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more          162.3355013381934
 she supposed if he meant any thing he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter          436.2586244193213
 i should like it beyond any thing          343.1861768887059
 you cannot be too much on your guard          210.31171660954436
 mr          194.34758364312268
 after amusing himself some time with their curiosity he thus explained          957.9804890974847
 this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening in summer the windows are full west          878.3776600256933
 it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife          308.41224339321553
how could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance which she had been obliged to give in the other          235.29061284448667
and if i may mention so delicate a subject endeavour to check that little something bordering on conceit and impertinence which your lady possesses          1025.4795815341688
 miss lucas called soon after breakfast and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before          316.79434272414125
 darcy will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right          712.6790357970455
 you refuse to obey the claims of duty honour and gratitude          887.3552428058866
 as the weather was fine they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park          444.72819714620374
 his behaviour to us has in every respect been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire          296.2023910595123
but it is always so          181.22212427814205
 our plain manner of living our small rooms and few domestics and the little we see of the world must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly          328.3931968247254
 lady lucas was a very good kind of woman not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to mrs          237.6459354616864
 the church ought to have been my professioni was brought up for the church and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now          326.98643806118383
 is her husband is the son of his late fathers steward to be his brother          262.9941049126071
 i quite detest the man          699.4787963033331
 at length every idea seemed to fail him and after standing a few moments without saying a word he suddenly recollected himself and took leave          455.47853663795803
 she was not sorry however to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung          183.56948838068803
 darcy walked off and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him          520.3600680084038
 elizabeth tried to join in her fathers pleasantry but could only force one most reluctant smile          1147.0453649888468
 if he wishes to avoid seeing me he must go          389.14848003127435
 it was painful exceedingly painful to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return          440.654861181076
 there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed          657.0533451821922
 but are you pleased jane          322.74042994523114
 at length the parsonage was discernible          1380.4931890360879
 seriously however she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentlemans concurrence          683.1712651857752
 gardiner who fatigued by the exercise of the morning found elizabeths arm inadequate to her support and consequently preferred her husbands          833.1730391386232
 i will have no reserves from you          200.75068295767701
 those who do not complain are never pitied          1461.225964616042
but norecollecting herselfthat could never be my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me i should not have been allowed to invite them          199.65007269353185
 bingley and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity for he was discovered to be proud to be above his company and above being pleased and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding disagreeable countenance and being unworthy to be compared with his friend          465.59220704469874
 even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr          552.3634085995358
 i must go instantly to my mother she cried          251.56233094555643
 bennets sour looks and illnatured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away          1836.3449359594417
 that you certainly shall          289.3361133264929
 i cannot but wonder however at her having any such fears now because if he had at all cared about me we must have met long long ago          429.3009086973361
 that is very true said elizabeth though it had not occurred to me before          140.09984542198464
 but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration and gave most gracious smiles especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them          919.5583265150296
 what he told me was merely this that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage but without mentioning names or any other particulars and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer          411.5490868249819
 it was the prospect of constant society and good society he added which was my chief inducement to enter the shire          438.12978682357783
 it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he should          398.2252991477518
 a man of honour could not have doubted the intention but mr          290.48846804141846
 bingley replied that he did and made his congratulations          265.5358000691379
 elizabeth privately added and how much i shall have to conceal          447.20278918483723
 his revenge would have been complete indeed          1223.550660218586
 had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcys opinion and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps          520.8665264275701
 do you prefer reading to cards          1108.5079445309866
 he protested that except lady catherine and her daughter he had never seen a more elegant woman for she had not only received him with the utmost civility but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening although utterly unknown to her before          271.13333775704353
 on opening the door she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth as if engaged in earnest conversation and had this led to no suspicion the faces of both as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other would have told it all          408.5833684252913
 his regard for her was quite imaginary and the possibility of her deserving her mothers reproach prevented his feeling any regret          481.623217668624
 i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge          198.28025080579542
 said she          173.0878387619306
 nay if you are so serious about it i shall consider the matter as absolutely settled          488.5082839247167
elizabeth was in agonies          962.3898642733086
 yet the misery for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation received soon afterwards material relief from observing how much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her former lover          679.3711327810006
 jane listened with astonishment and concernshe knew not how to believe that mr          383.5398576880368
but she had chosen it with her eyes open and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go she did not seem to ask for compassion          381.29068964550953
 i enquired after their brother of course          483.9732280933679
 nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related          341.28025181372726
 some of them were to dine with the philipses the next day and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr          194.43514363618803
 mary and kitty have been very kind and would have shared in every fatigue i am sure but i did not think it right for either of them          192.58440292020953
 you must send john with the young ladies mrs          389.6366685657138
 what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation          270.17117383334255
 good gracious          8289.50374597645
 darcy was punctual in his return and as lydia informed you attended the wedding          383.87007770403403
 bennet          423.3157894736842
 bennets eyes sparkled with pleasure and she was eagerly calling out while her daughter read well jane who is it from          380.4006725994349
 i often tell my other girls they are nothing to her          257.3350969439704
it now first struck her that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of hunsford parsonage and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings in the absence of more eligible visitors          388.08322810166925
 has she any family          290.5748646321114
 her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way          456.99766043801304
 kitty and lydia take his defection much more to heart than i do          481.9813022878505
 bingley looked a little silly at this reflection and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business          321.2542649614411
 that he was not a goodtempered man had been her firmest opinion          465.2843928004044
 oh          6970.6
 how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains          666.2753514239556
 perhaps i do          316.05628698815804
 you blamed me for coming          1134.437060857773
 with a stronger voice she soon added i have this comfort immediately that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side and that it has done no harm to any one but myself          264.47679559403883
 i mend pens remarkably well          4126.485687235085
 collins had been taken in thirdly she trusted that they would never be happy together and fourthly that the match might be broken off          674.143597850009
 vanity and pride are different things though the words are often used synonimously          1199.971154402568
 would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe          1689.1163983997433
 she saw with the creative eye of fancy the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers          1714.1581171145217
 but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible or at least it was impossible not to try for information          159.61488422909818
 her nose wants character there is nothing marked in its lines          1448.089234959136
 darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as gracechurch street but he would hardly think a months ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities were he once to enter it and depend upon it mr          468.80378734748854
 mr          194.34758364312268
 lydia my love though you are the youngest i dare say mr          346.38342244065876
 absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte again and weakened her disgust of mr          671.6904700098415
 i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life          295.56093092341234
 darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do          153.3095116948701
 elizabeth soon heard from her friend and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been that it should be equally unreserved was impossible          347.04608530744866
 and mrs          128.4276194761616
 they will join me early tomorrow he continued and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with youmr          850.4996868053416
 but people themselves alter so much that there is something new to be observed in them for ever          426.155130624521
 nothing on the contrary could be more natural and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both and could very sincerely wish him happy          417.4980936768124
i described and enforced them earnestly          1972.8950561626543
 she is on her road somewhere i dare say and so passing through meryton thought she might as well call on you          399.38117106509327
 mr          194.34758364312268
 may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are the result of previous study          774.4557045954914
 no          254.4014598540146
 they crossed it by a simple bridge in character with the general air of the scene it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited and the valley here contracted into a glen allowed room only for the stream and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppicewood which bordered it          1160.0157532596259
 theres for you          1158.5201757770074
 but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging          606.5102906896274
 it may do very well for the others replied mr          234.27320604521094
 the strangeness of mr          561.4816432858978
 bennet shaking her head then she is better off than many girls          710.7783359797954
 the officers will find women better worth their notice          1071.672662146462
 yet he is such a man          146.762527031788
 no more have i said mr          155.10314046669802
 and may i ask          220.2388954620999
 if it was to be secret said jane say not another word on the subject          277.33439985767376
 gardiner and after relating the circumstances she thus went oni am now convinced my dear aunt that i have never been much in love for had i really experienced that pure and elevating passion i should at present detest his very name and wish him all manner of evil          671.0448196637626
 brighton and a whole campful of soldiers to us who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia and the monthly balls of meryton          1216.0090691573143
 then addressing her daughter oh          2179.236114870408
 hurst and elizabeth herself          263.012295177566
 who would have thought she could be so thin and small          166.29541091535896
 bennet sat quite still and unable to utter a syllable          774.9221544355904
 the horses were post and neither the carriage nor the livery of the servant who preceded it were familiar to them          595.5082877789281
 in confirmation of this she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected without actually naming her authority but stating it to be such as might be relied on          643.6935701559153
 allow me to say however that your fair partner does not disgrace you and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated especially when a certain desirable event my dear miss eliza glancing at her sister and bingley shall take place          344.14239557231485
 the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt          271.3331217241944
 wickham by each of them and in the mean time she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married to mrs          174.58303590630044
 elizabeths impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned and preparing her to be surprised she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr          365.22783605276163
 collins          829.8333333333333
 those were your words          660.8538147417376
 my visit was not long as caroline and mrs          245.8382401028558
 there is a lady it seems a mrs          231.20717183361245
 his anxiety for jane was evident and his attentions to herself most pleasing and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others          308.2445153659053
 bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth i am glad you are come back lizzy          197.72979511435722
 never mind miss lizzys hair          8687.649326202589
 but mrs          250.1030374232019
 and your assurance of it i suppose carried immediate conviction to him          387.2832759662051
 march was to take elizabeth to hunsford          423.2929078125243
 now was the moment for her resolution to be executed and while her courage was high she immediately said mr          263.46093710668094
 she studied every sentence and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different          1262.2116256365955
 but it was not to be          5.756371719673444
how merry we shall be together when we meet          972.6450334914446
 but tell me what did you come down to netherfield for          232.98555929940358
 collins who entered with an air more stately than usual and on perceiving whom she said to the girls now i do insist upon it that you all of you hold your tongues and let mr          353.0360828397605
 if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew i shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh          283.6730610935651
 she blushed at the very idea and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk          176.90218823755953
 darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty he had looked at her without admiration at the ball and when they next met he looked at her only to criticise          278.00861110513995
 and mrs          128.4276194761616
to convince him therefore that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point          453.11141061070595
 very much          298.53185258713347
 i fancy lizzy that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all          525.2125402793673
 till the next morning however she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance          176.74246846578816
 i dare say you will find him very agreeable          299.7364662942704
 but these things happen so often          929.3764333565057
 how does georgiana get on darcy          992.8830844138708
 she cried          268.37656216988734
 with a glance she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility and to imitate his politeness she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place but she had not got beyond the words delightful and charming when some unlucky recollections obtruded and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her might be mischievously construed          493.9636740921124
impossible          2751.5526315789475
 now said she that this first meeting is over i feel perfectly easy          438.48743772889463
 collins with a formal wave of the hand that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept when he first applies for their favour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time          544.2127504884305
 come be quick be quick          1429.0918940939753
 bingley i always keep servants that can do their own work my daughters are brought up differently          679.729465897073
 elizabeth coloured and saida little          1997.0633047860808
 society i own is necessary to me          318.685604016447
 the collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave and if you are not kind to us brother i do not know what we shall do          189.22571992296636
 you may readily comprehend she added what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us and comparatively speaking a stranger to our family should have been amongst you at such a time          314.4533656038165
 elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said you are mistaken mr          469.5550558432217
 i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance          341.14828553969403
 miss darcys praise occupied the chief of it          547.3762752637692
 what will be his surprise thought she when he knows who they are          291.5793979241647
 i never saw such a woman          71.51688827283704
 she could think of nothing else and yet whether bingleys regard had really died away or were suppressed by his friends interference whether he had been aware of janes attachment or whether it had escaped his observation whichever were the case though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference her sisters situation remained the same her peace equally wounded          511.016294889163
 and this cried darcy as he walked with quick steps across the room is your opinion of me          364.4591733406351
 i have already told her so once by your desire          365.3249898661006
 her performance was pleasing though by no means capital          395.3408744305883
 bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn          222.97433727285974
 the house furniture neighbourhood and roads were all to her taste and lady catherines behaviour was most friendly and obliging          596.2252794481567
 darcy observed miss bingley in a half whisper that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes          453.6797554805037
 his fear of her has always operated i know when they were together and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh which i am certain he has very much at heart          242.56223740770312
 of mr          79.33831064769187
 hurst thought the same and added she has nothing in short to recommend her but being an excellent walker          380.1789280112971
 in pompous nothings on his side and civil assents on that of his cousins their time passed till they entered meryton          766.4744252569085
 gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off          512.7820439343964
 balls will be absolutely prohibited unless you stand up with one of your sisters          649.5085014781124
 it is very hard to think that she might have been mr          95.03725003097027
 but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes          342.6164733514197
 the advice was followed readily for the feverish symptoms increased and her head ached acutely          2084.6355557279203
 darcy gave her the letter did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers she had formed no expectation at all of its contents          272.3138406837746
 i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myselffor i am fond of superior society but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas          580.978630418979
 i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh and of her mother lady catherine          499.5526982327442
 i did not know that you intended to walk said miss bingley in some confusion lest they had been overheard          276.2742102605516
 i am going to open the instrument eliza and you know what follows          352.19986210259253
 he had followed them purposely to town he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise and where he was reduced to meet frequently meet reason with persuade and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to avoid and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce          583.5340563770671
 you may depend upon it madam said miss bingley with cold civility that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us          479.04862264347526
 they were ignorant idle and vain          824.8155588762147
 oh          6970.6
 his manners are very different from his cousins          395.6717035642874
 i hope said she as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day you will give your motherinlaw a few hints when this desirable event takes place as to the advantage of holding her tongue and if you can compass it do cure the younger girls of running after the officers          480.00334049708437
 darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sisters refusal must have given him          344.3553670347528
 where does discretion end and avarice begin          4617.9009959564555
 she told the story however with great spirit among her friends for she had a lively playful disposition which delighted in any thing ridiculous          575.6829280820509
 oh          6970.6
 this he considered sufficient encouragement and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately followed          350.90626278958666
 after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence health good humour and cheerfulness began to reappear at longbourn          727.7339883185304
 they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds          1947.3497784654567
 can you come tomorrow          615.5969522987167
 gardiner then rallied her niece on wickhams desertion and complimented her on bearing it so well          1330.5838939849812
 allow me by the way to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer          222.5696274039339
 to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying          1357.2778581636153
 certainly not at first          331.86867719437964
 but i wonder how long you would have gone on if you had been left to yourself          198.48747359663463
 it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection          997.5744001923377
 jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention          330.6289185680778
 oh          6970.6
 a person may be proud without being vain          626.9493118513849
 the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield          380.3782460913353
 on reaching the house they were shewn through the hall into the saloon whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer          1502.3902771351618
 elizabeth would wonder and probably would blame her and though her resolution was not to be shaken her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation          201.42363671367426
 on the very day of my coming home from longbourn your uncle had a most unexpected visitor          201.4156243260493
 bingley must be down again in the summer          107.68996573491835
 whatever he might afterwards persuade her to it was not on her side a scheme of infamy          300.9098754352173
 my dear mr          307.16849388656607
 i shall see her in january          329.4047834411383
 elizabeth thanked him from her heart and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying          611.606327797752
 darcy and their niece directed their observation towards each with an earnest though guarded enquiry and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love          497.34663160607107
 the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends and she could do nothing but think and think with wonder of mr          147.20839662993112
 bennets leaving them together after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master she could not help saying oh          339.0526922565534
 but perhaps mr          249.37456688481117
 mr          194.34758364312268
 sometimes one officer sometimes another had been her favourite as their attentions raised them in her opinion          627.5079207154014
 c          10455.9
 as they passed through the hall lady catherine opened the doors into the diningparlour and drawingroom and pronouncing them after a short survey to be decent looking rooms walked on          816.352010226838
 but you will know it when i have told you what happened the very next day          169.5799536778129
 no lizzy let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame          372.55904904754783
 but i can guess how it was every body says that he is ate up with pride and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs          281.85326686993824
 the fact is that you were sick of civility of deference of officious attention          367.8837348609283
 they were now almost at the door of the house for she had walked fast to get rid of him and unwilling for her sisters sake to provoke him she only said in reply with a goodhumoured smile come mr          229.8776839088113
 bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again having still a great deal to say to her and many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends          281.0155705204451
 are you indeed          290.54631415831705
 there is not a finer county in england than derbyshire          1017.2256039074573
 but who could have foreseen such an attention as this          433.56155306423693
 when first he entered the corps she was ready enough to admire him but so we all were          257.1084580977661
 mr          194.34758364312268
 his behaviour to her sister was such during dinner time as shewed an admiration of her which though more guarded than formerly persuaded elizabeth that if left wholly to himself janes happiness and his own would be speedily secured          457.4450230480294
 your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable          561.054661786313
 your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know and if as you were mounting your horse a friend were to say bingley you had better stay till next week you would probably do it you would probably not goand at another word might stay a month          550.7506973152348
 from mr          209.5579337043928
 gardiner had formed of their being followed by a letter from him had ended in nothing          231.64476852040582
 younge was he knew intimately acquainted with wickham and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town          218.89097243561798
 the observations of her uncle and aunt now began and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected          147.3098792450938
do you know mr          236.8249569753861
 nosaid darcy i have made no such pretension          817.8698565659078
 his affection was proved to have been sincere and his conduct cleared of all blame unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend          449.1453180569075
 it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr          151.3614020258362
 by this time she is actually with them          268.5871927277284
 but we must stem the tide of malice and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation          2506.7189265330967
 you know nothing of the matter          217.1900453345485
 his pride never deserts him but with the rich he is liberalminded just sincere rational honourable and perhaps agreeableallowing something for fortune and figure          1246.4418815591418
 the gentlemen came and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes but alas          171.54303016559115
 darcy said nothing at all          201.86996483807107
 has your governess left you          861.0890069605238
 darcy made no answer          107.91982447475723
 you may well be surprised miss bennet at such an assertion after seeing as you probably might the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday          546.5122412830656
 i am not ashamed of having been mistakenor at least it is slight it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters          205.49655795358206
 mr          194.34758364312268
 would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress          311.2909396269068
 i have nothing either to hope or fear and nothing to reproach him with          274.6127914218044
 it would vex me indeed to see you again the dupe of miss bingleys pretended regard          1144.2645325981748
 i have a warm unguarded temper and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him and to him too freely          358.050615586093
 he could be still amiable still pleasing to my uncle and aunt when he was in town and why not to me          167.23816983445894
 i wish i could say for the sake of her family that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible amiable wellinformed woman for the rest of her life though perhaps it was lucky for her husband who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly          254.81953753965217
 it was not till the afternoon when he joined them at tea that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject and then on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured he replied say nothing of that          294.72285725538575
 i am by no means of opinion i assure you said he that a ball of this kind given by a young man of character to respectable people can have any evil tendency and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours miss elizabeth for the two first dances especiallya preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause and not to any disrespect for her          196.5391661539554
 gardiner has done for them because wickham has not sixpence of his own          572.6934179387531
 no no nonsense lizzy          1214.6133379531866
 it is a long time mr          179.4241734416471
 sometime hence it will be all found out and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before          493.49673728896977
 they were rather handsome had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds were in the habit of spending more than they ought and of associating with people of rank and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves and meanly of others          336.0651473382845
 darcy with an expression of halflaughing alarm          946.8225999723347
 oh          6970.6
 they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece who astonished and confused scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family          385.5199258268878
 every disposition of the ground was good and she looked on the whole scene the river the trees scattered on its banks and the winding of the valley as far as she could trace it with delight          481.52420354594085
 steady to his purpose he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour he adhered most conscientiously to his book and would not even look at her          331.71719345791695
 he did not talk to me of his own arts said fitzwilliam smiling          387.07963196324687
 but i knew i should persuade you at last          301.3921913786253
 my beauty you had early withstood and as for my mannersmy behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not          453.8388908996847
 the carriage was sent to meet them at and they were to return in it by dinnertime          225.29391957495315
 nowhy should he          2177.7625029838778
 all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over          403.874415345773
 i knew you would be wishing me joy          474.24504644516
lady catherine was a tall large woman with stronglymarked features which might once have been handsome          1083.5766837964302
 mr          194.34758364312268
 pray do not talk of that odious man          748.3657725632739
 wickhams attentions          3443.9103315689663
 said he smiling          654.9069810807449
 excuse mefor i must speak plainly          3629.3865761345146
 there is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping i dare say          801.3444693540958
 she burst into tears as she alluded to it and for a few minutes could not speak another word          208.82386516532068

 said he as he joined her          158.20847199655404
 he was fond of the country and of books and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments          482.7601284898903
 bennet accepted the challenge observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements          1175.9694822071622
 the surprise of the rest of the family on hearing who their visitor had been was very great but they obligingly satisfied it with the same kind of supposition which had appeased mrs          300.3489803784522
 you are safe from me          404.48821311032447
 my dear jane i am in such a flutter that i am sure i cant write so i will dictate and you write for me          226.96892319906507
 collinss correspondence for any consideration          1540.679797165513
 when convinced on that article miss bennet had nothing farther to wish          579.1803296438223
 clements because wickhams lodgings were in that parish          2082.653305519465
 you may in fact carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire my dear cousin          603.090178587689
 bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication          289.2514577844256
 elizabeth as they drove along watched for the first appearance of pemberley woods with some perturbation and when at length they turned in at the lodge her spirits were in a high flutter          412.24494616889024
 upon my word i say no more here than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood except netherfield          257.0140675303603
i told you in the library you know that i should never speak to you again and you will find me as good as my word          141.60793833888692
 collins has made you an offer of marriage          48.16116483747287
 collins for she vows she will not have him and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her          102.94680413330214
 i am not likely to leave kent for some time          415.4452456969791

 chapter iii          33485.67926741221
 you know not what you are about          261.6786634848235
 said she i heard you before but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply          143.81944416347972
 darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side and that if it were it must belong to mr          234.76186853447427
 the particulars i reserve till we meet          818.9577847951521
 and you saw the old housekeeper i suppose          378.93349816637016
 and what sort of young lady is she          132.11765122490107
 collins she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr          192.13391131692566
 a man who had felt less might          386.50635225540833
 bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life every body had been most kind and attentive to him there had been no formality no stiffness he had soon felt acquainted with all the room and as to miss bennet he could not conceive an angel more beautiful          481.9253294318843
 the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt there cannot be two opinions on that point          338.8646079897852
 for my part i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody          146.63671566149773
 bennet but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befal you you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it          216.3667299465223
 we have heard only once          544.8437277725316
 and mary king is safe          1282.7194524185468
 i perfectly comprehend your feelings and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been          236.6752414993751
 let us sit down          1744.2504446294965
 besides it will not much signify what one wears this summer after the shire have left meryton and they are going in a fortnight          611.105233926757
 cried elizabeth i am excessively diverted          526.6633943069148
 in this room they were received by miss darcy who was sitting there with mrs          269.08319927257685
 the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for herthat she was not enough recovered but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right          234.83807747333844
 her father was walking about the room looking grave and anxious          290.1076415944609
 mr          194.34758364312268
 mrs          525.4221105527638
 lizzy said he what are you doing          360.8792703481249
 and when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether mr          573.8554145158977
 chapter xx          38665.93187807582
 had i but explained some part of it onlysome part of what i learnt to my own family          454.434449116228
 bennets means for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband          513.1839464525909
 there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law          511.3445350112399
 when her mother went up to her dressingroom at night she followed her and made the important communication          349.30348928488166
 to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire when that conviction had been given was scarcely the work of a moment          386.75583905167343
 she would not give him time to reply but hurrying instantly to her husband called out as she entered the library oh          278.59377263728425
 in the afternoon the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries which jane was equally eager to satisfy          411.85633179797173
 then observed elizabeth you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman          235.14471340991471
 but georgiana would not join her          443.87138673002937
 it cannot be for me it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened          307.83645577968286
 his father miss bennet the late mr          378.9505182836134
 why is not every body as happy          385.39899724137945
 it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other womans of superior execution          278.5088377534388
 wickhams chief object was unquestionably my sisters fortune which is thirty thousand pounds but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement          999.5175289114416
 about a year ago she was taken from school and an establishment formed for her in london and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it to ramsgate and thither also went mr          513.5713924641938
 darcy that they scarcely ever saw him          328.1378035250205
 darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner          646.0288963940628
 i should say one of her ladyships carriages for she has several          437.6381073450108
 i thank you for my share of the favour said elizabeth but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands          256.8930237365892
 kitty and me were to spend the day there and mrs          111.97229275889768
 you are each of you so complying that nothing will ever be resolved on so easy that every servant will cheat you and so generous that you will always exceed your income          527.3712370472133
 mr          194.34758364312268
 i am sincerely grieved for him and mrs          445.96550293239784
 darcy to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection          264.1193002296368
 could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections          283.8359346607752
 what say you mary          460.4981082665986
 you are lucky in having such a master          426.44815424313515
 what does mr          318.2738234250853
 bennets carriage was to meet them they quickly perceived in token of the coachmans punctuality both kitty and lydia looking out of a diningroom up stairs          1181.4049024907401
 i am astonished said miss bingley that my father should have left so small a collection of books          459.44987057698415
 he was most highly esteemed by mr          412.80007316916044
 the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had made a great difference in the country and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees          374.48059738892334
 it is admirable          909.3819701584239
 it was rather small but well built and convenient and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit          658.5405978434377
 no indeed          430.64719010296454
 hope was over entirely over and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter she found little except the professed affection of the writer that could give her any comfort          252.95812060514555
 he must write his own sermons and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties and the care and improvement of his dwelling which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible          405.34828307049963
 i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us          130.9448126560967
 elizabeth took up some needlework and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion          568.2086931660208
 mr          194.34758364312268
 with the mention of derbyshire there were many ideas connected          495.7248858003712
 collins and myself on this happy event let me now add a short hint on the subject of another of which we have been advertised by the same authority          361.8881070469847
 elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants          95.78735183737247
 thank god          14891.526251912013
 her sister made not the smallest objection and the pianoforte was opened and darcy after a few moments recollection was not sorry for it          134.30736626752972
 mrs          525.4221105527638
 between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again          623.7027433036078
 stone          104559.00000000001
 she read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes          378.16275484588357
 bennet was not in the habit of walking mary could never spare time but the remaining five set off together          458.1122636286161
 your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters          465.21887310671985
 she followed her father to the fire place and they both sat down          330.036356518913
 mrs          525.4221105527638
 it is such a spur to ones genius such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind          466.76135881230664
 it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence a most country town indifference to decorum          853.8384859147156
 bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister that they did not once sit down to a family dinner          168.06270650963455
 the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane and in short as the time drew near she would have been very sorry for any delay          181.53670267994323
 i can easily believe it          374.52597879989816
 who is to fight wickham and make him marry her if he comes away          368.1632881407921
 after a slight preparation for good news the letter was read aloud          907.2526612075848
 bingley and under your orders          533.38790840289
 vain indeed must be all her attentions vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself if he were already selfdestined to another          358.26980701332116
 she was very equal therefore to address mr          292.7226962450241
 these recollections will not do at all          391.20829347169393
 the communication excited many professions of concern and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane and till the morrow their going was deferred          427.1939629005421
 darcy though she had not before known its extent agreed equally well with his own words          594.1627486124396
i shall not be able to keep youand so i warn you          187.051018508849
 he began to wish to know more of her and as a step towards conversing with her himself attended to her conversation with others          189.6264204357035
 he likes to have his own way very well replied colonel fitzwilliam          460.3974673316432
 we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel forsters          559.1544198509954
 the far and the near must be relative and depend on many varying circumstances          580.1080579271253
 she is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all          228.9698037001249
how much i shall have to tell          233.39917216519848
 if as i conclude will be the case you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business i will immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper settlement          799.6662015691343
 no i believe not          201.78002694368664
 a clear ten thousand per annum          6517.853747759511
 she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas who often joined them and goodnaturedly engaged mr          399.4983786004893
 mrs          525.4221105527638
 such relief however as it was in her power to afford by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences she frequently sent them          285.39305447708574
 elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase and listened with all her heart but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry          357.09764042457215
 pride and prejudice a novel          83.53651118549118
 wickham himself          585.1196220884689
 but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man whom they had never seen before of most gentlemanlike appearance walking with an officer on the other side of the way          274.9144842973931
 bingley to her          76.71035917395184
 his first object with her he acknowledged had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her offering his assistance as far as it would go          224.76134952259451
but i will not torment you with vain wishes which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks          555.5119945397308
 this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers but mrs          313.3033753892311
 you have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him          131.63212751597223
 we will settle with your father about the money afterwards but the things should be ordered immediately          485.0007479815564
 in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton and see how every body went on but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme          358.4745687548212
 mrs          525.4221105527638
 ah          104559.00000000001
 but lizzy you have been very sly very reserved with me          500.2310918459794
 what a triumph for him as she often thought could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now have been gladly and gratefully received          750.2414407373149
i must be in town next saturday          441.4276343528591
 they talked of his sister his friends his house his fruit of every thing but himself yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs          402.7134208394925
 there are few people in england i suppose who have more true enjoyment of music than myself or a better natural taste          611.6061061822952
 in this perturbed state of mind with thoughts that could rest on nothing she walked on but it would not do in half a minute the letter was unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she could she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence          277.5461395631114
 on finding mrs          712.2757454308604
 a clergyman like you must marry          591.7962363184705
 are quite well          500.63247477378695
 i dare say mr          537.4876357632995
 charlotte says she hardly ever does          959.6458780485617
 it was too early in the morning for visitors and besides the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours          277.35817459514885
 she will make him a very proper wife          298.5365191789098
 it could not be for society as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips and when he did speak it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choicea sacrifice to propriety not a pleasure to himself          404.03179361639536
 but when the gentlemen entered jane was no longer the first object          316.62296167603785
 mrs          525.4221105527638
 in such an exigence my uncles advice and assistance would be every thing in the world he will immediately comprehend what i must feel and i rely upon his goodness          471.88019090292164
 it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom          215.96630835254427
 they were off saturday night about twelve as is conjectured but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight          1201.8579075733417
 merely to the illustration of your character said she endeavouring to shake off her gravity          669.81997826606
 it is because he will not give himself the trouble          258.053236792976
 cried he with more feeling than politeness then recollecting himself i will not detain you a minute but let me or let the servant go after mr          553.1156632762728
 why could not he keep on quarrelling with you as his father did before him          366.82665751456204
 a little time therefore          321.8128200402672
 there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings          984.0778773080584
 my dear brother at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece and such as upon the whole i hope will give you satisfaction          315.96079215799415
 but it ought to be done and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done directly          158.94255358708025
 her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies          516.868964122047
 very well          358.4021203846928
do not you darcy          258.7183263487898
 bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him          331.08522860257733
 lydia declared herself satisfied          1361.2586863764934
 gardiners house where they were to remain a few days          734.4941011853574
 collins wants to marry lizzy          790.4446731818207
 darcy mentioned his letter          475.544685915904
 elizabeth related to jane the next day what had passed between mr          116.35089362226532
 bingley if he had been imposed on would have much to suffer when the affair became public          295.2422017012413
 you mentioned two instances          1685.7766220732137
 darcy          365.59090909090907
 his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn          462.77136779600556
 darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well and as far as their acquaintance reached there was no fault to find          256.74957987292106
 bennet and as he spoke he left the room fatigued with the raptures of his wife          312.7193909849186
 miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcys marriage but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley she dropt all her resentment was fonder than ever of georgiana almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth          751.3140161889637
 as her successor in that house she regarded her with jealous abhorrence          885.3984147668024
 if elizabeth when mr          269.8856486434032
 she tried however to compose herself to answer him with patience when he should have done          383.1420143289441
 chapter i          490.0612756780165
 their reception from mr          413.46276297908287
 she is now about miss elizabeth bennets height or rather taller          1383.1483710314244
 bennet as much as possible saying not much to elizabeth and nothing at all to the others          98.77269501238221
 wickhams being among them          1326.326395415749
 they were of a respectable family in the north of england a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brothers fortune and their own had been acquired by trade          779.3815196046227
he has always something to say to every body          308.9766028189446
 darcy only smiled and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again          1073.5443101159817
 they entered it in one of its lowest points and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent          960.0558887386173
 mr          194.34758364312268
 the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side allowed them to see him before they met          516.5863948725923
 however he wrote some verses on her and very pretty they were          438.328453487256
 oh yes          4188.460920699713
 i did not know before that i had two daughters on the brink of matrimony          112.44212840328767
 in seeing bingley her thoughts naturally flew to her sister and oh          517.5476547985793
 i have been making the tour of the park he replied as i generally do every year and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage          327.48290238903616
 you mistake me my dear          519.9283265180005
 dear lizzy          857.3194790739335
 she would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions          315.4947155054052
 but though this might be imaginary she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy who had been set up as a rival of jane          167.73710904440088
 you are a great deal too apt you know to like people in general          410.71312539622676
 my dear niece i have just received your letter and shall devote this whole morning to answering it as i foresee that a little writing will not comprise what i have to tell you          479.7926023199291
 why will you think so          353.50852686404914
 collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love for mrs          393.98037122657405
 i am perfectly convinced by it that mr          250.16050036170438
 nor was her respect for him though it made her more quiet at all likely to make her more elegant          255.73687988952457
 elizabeth who knew this to be levelled at mr          507.8318516289594
 exceed their income          8186.455117993281
 there is no danger of wickhams marrying mary king          991.9954527488014
 i mean that no man in his senses would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred ayear during my life and fifty after i am gone          561.6506753338024
 four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister          491.1343316967937
 i did not wink at you          500.63340480323996
 said elizabeth to herself          142.65419428439185
 miss bingleys eyes were instantly turned towards darcy and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps          447.35729890918475
 in that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks and to mrs          288.3914215042839
 and his sisters are charming women          496.8463770465759
 it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of some conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible          197.82354647216522
 my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself with due consideration for the advantage of all your family and if my manner has been at all reprehensible i here beg leave to apologise          309.8819251033327
 and if you will stay another month complete it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london for i am going there early in june for a week and as dawson does not object to the barouche box there will be very good room for one of youand indeed if the weather should happen to be cool i should not object to taking you both as you are neither of you large          434.3494241017214
 collins for a few moments he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh          154.40660104860197
 and is such a girl to be my nephews sister          252.09039591864115
 i had no notion but he would go a shooting or something or other and not disturb us with his company          562.0413229776658
 elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him and mr          268.88289726325905
 cried he with an air of awkward gallantry and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents my proposals will not fail of being acceptable          561.6840769134192
 let me recommend you however as a friend not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions for as to mr          438.62739446193615
 but really maam i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early          282.97136928111047
 he is a pleasant fellow and would jilt you creditably          1323.4142097634106
 nothing had ever suggested it before but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece          329.63185918635406
 her astonishment at his comingat his coming to netherfield to longbourn and voluntarily seeking her again was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire          383.159549915492
here you are in your own family          275.20781712406114
 in lydias imagination a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness          1660.6239056103097
 she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct          487.6054484162574
 they solaced their wretchedness however by duets after supper while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister          706.5428885516283
 but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marryingand moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife as i certainly did          312.249962518
 what is to become of us          19.247681021243476
 you were not by when i told mamma and the others all about it          202.59779539991956
 did you go by the village of kympton          696.7899377169284
 about ten or a dozen years ago before her marriage she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire to which he belonged          423.4644737897137
 and her calling here was prodigiously civil          793.8026857991948
 exclaimed elizabeth you are too good          523.1717015982779
 and my aunt philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good added kitty          221.4721832290093
 they could talk of nothing but officers and mr          238.62286754065804
 thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him but this step and let us rejoice over it marks nothing bad at heart          1087.3155823142508
 in a doleful voice mrs          1748.1924782472845
 chapter xv          38665.93187807582
 haggerston has our directions and all will be completed in a week          1004.7820283344466
 lady catherine hesitated for a moment and then replied the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind          405.06798295690817
 the second began          562.4355236524066
 you thought the waiter must not hear as if he cared          425.8944440685378
 noi do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did          393.82486778609655
 mr          194.34758364312268
 as for your elizabeths picture you must not attempt to have it taken for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes          583.4587373204454
 elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county she was a most active magistrate in her own parish the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by mr          336.1785909938929
 and have you heard from him often          114.96213002426626
 it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case          43.133355539833566
 many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of lydias connections which is not likely can i suppose her so lost to every thing          228.84448403428624
 bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject and affectionately taking her hand said in reply do not make yourself uneasy my love          205.42180869972182
 miss lydia is going to be married and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding          400.4410440742327
 but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents          518.9705112820318
 oh          6970.6
 long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with mr          166.82331041501794
 not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcys meditated elopement          934.5806340090456
 i am sorry exceedingly sorry replied darcy in a tone of surprise and emotion that you have ever been informed of what may in a mistaken light have given you uneasiness          439.65945783470687
 is not he a charming man          254.2723866193755
 you did          195.5318687518424
 she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him and turned away with a degree of ill humour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr          229.71010043493345
 i felt a little uneasya little fearful of my sisters happiness with him in marriage because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right          421.7225727631544
 now lizzy i think i have surprised you          147.36833377899725
 my dear father she cried come back and write immediately          483.5860078834104
 collins by janes introduction of him          448.1553235791588
 to jane herself she exclaimed there could be no possibility of objection          254.48802383985577
 they can only wish his happiness and if he is attached to me no other woman can secure it          237.73398781994905
 how can you contrive to write so even          584.684585365239
 she was quite amazed at her own discomposure but amongst other causes of disquiet she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour and more than commonly anxious to please she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her          666.3115541711942
 his eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling was more openly acknowledged for she did not scruple to call out what is that you are saying fitzwilliam          331.03729307117675
 the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucass last week and even mr          530.9870380906918
 you cannot be more than twenty i am suretherefore you need not conceal your age          955.8884343609066
 the feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation          459.5304528574607
 bennet was really in a most pitiable state          473.82281603520653
 but they did pass away and mr          249.48357444859695
 now what have you to say          179.0425442777732
 collins you must marry          478.5516211004262
 howsoever that may be you are grievously to be pitied in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs          603.9481652844808
 darcy drew his chair a little towards her and said you cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment          427.41718586476736
 oh          6970.6
 well cried her mother it is all very right who should do it but her own uncle          213.79145681586024
 she could neither wonder nor condemn but the belief of his selfconquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom afforded no palliation of her distress          1339.9897601208215
 i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours he coldly replied          921.3789748737356
 her mother stepped forwards embraced her and welcomed her with rapture gave her hand with an affectionate smile to wickham who followed his lady and wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness          581.250864023999
 dear me          431.9842879063058
 bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father who had intended to purchase an estate but did not live to do it          673.77069069392
 i beg your pardon          88.31780322224736
 but what does he say of the living          109.96583615459495
 they had all been very illused since she last saw her sister          538.0269714546874
 a small part of derbyshire is all the present concern          361.50092456137224
 i should be sorry indeed if it were          108.98466395297342
 you are not going to be missish i hope and pretend to be affronted at an idle report          430.79279809761823
what advantage can it be to you to offend mr          282.59977084460513
 you excel so much in the dance miss eliza that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general he can have no objection i am sure to oblige us for one half hour          393.22371469960837
 teaze himlaugh at him          4420.068981201308
 elizabeth was now to see mr          150.66511610981084
 let me first see how he behaves said she it will then be early enough for expectation          307.94392934010364
 yes miss bennet interest for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all          402.3147436756388
 she longed to enquire of the housekeeper whether her master were really absent but had not courage for it          435.7926927891831
 my dear hill have you heard the good news          478.5321300053776
 she cared for none of her friends she wanted no help of his she would not hear of leaving wickham          280.93264030011136
 how i should like to be married before any of you and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls          249.3607784841079
 i think she will          62.448702560725415
 how is such a man to be worked on          190.04360701655543
 you are a good girl he replied and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled          176.81592469700323
 of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant but of the truth of what i shall relate i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity          916.3313877566642
 her aunt now called her to look at a picture          280.75446208051915
 his marriage was now fast approaching and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable and even repeatedly to say in an illnatured tone that she wished they might be happy          316.67075120971384
 bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but he may never do more than like her if she does not help him on          298.93142780164044
 the dejection was almost universal          1292.8590719612614
 most willingly          7695.660605285585
 chapter xix          38665.93187807582
the part which i acted is now to be explained          351.28731051093945
 they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me which i cannot wonder at since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects          403.8916695345422
 elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either and was ever anxious to keep him to herself and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure it added to the hope of the future and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley          262.015372013793
 how can mr          332.4783764564972
 one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight          118.33726459701953
 collinss present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter to whom they could give little fortune and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair          506.73849695407074
 an airing would do me a great deal of good i am sure          265.6314749937933
 elizabeth longed to explore its windings but when they had crossed the bridge and perceived their distance from the house mrs          795.8814010405716
 and so did mrs          159.73841625648646
 he absolutely started and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise but shortly recovering himself advanced towards the party and spoke to elizabeth if not in terms of perfect composure at least of perfect civility          615.841891166694
 she was convinced that she could have been happy with him when it was no longer likely they should meet          163.9141605830428
 when i wrote that letter replied darcy i believed myself perfectly calm and cool but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit          592.4483431311967
 mr          194.34758364312268
 it must be his own doing          295.42292409952523
 gardiner declared his willingness and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation          421.97253574246076
 darcy          365.59090909090907
 his character was to speak for itself          255.3328466126756
 forster and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton where the temptations must be greater than at home          316.14220544620923
 as a brother a landlord a master she considered how many peoples happiness were in his guardianship          709.2149794708354
 darcy who was leaning against the mantlepiece with his eyes fixed on her face seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise          615.1607314513647
 but she is perfectly amiable and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies          791.2030499653538
 wickham and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in mr          220.86245543771204
 the families who had been in town for the winter came back again and summer finery and summer engagements arose          568.9058864442674
 the path just admitted three          1754.260574327337
he is his own master          273.9538216764624
 he who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection she now saw the object of open pleasantry          626.6271773001679
 two offences of a very different nature and by no means of equal magnitude you last night laid to my charge          461.500102192288
 if he fears me why come hither          1535.8301128092994
 bennet and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom          180.54002862297054
 i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that          189.79056742036272
 in spite of having been at st          605.2068517844616
 give my love to colonel forster i hope you will drink to our good journey          310.8847135833755
 it is something to think of and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions          269.9909004160881
 i am sick of mr          262.3162116080345
 but the case is this          188.15980232645595
 bingley for his kindness to jane with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy          461.25087129669805
 he said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying made no mention of the business that had taken him away and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it          86.28148382070079
 collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter          334.6530047042528
 and mrs          128.4276194761616
 the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely more i think than last year          716.2319689114735
 the lucases are very artful people indeed sister          993.9738747886589
 collins was eloquent in her praise          594.8560414459866
 not one          174.47253482054379
 lady catherine seemed resigned          2475.5377505529796
 she had been watching him the last hour she said as he walked up and down the street and had mr          148.75845445170359
 under such circumstances however he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief          355.03105379465006
 oh          6970.6
 bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them          374.60932240293465
 when the party broke up lydia returned with mrs          606.5452795054955
 after this day jane said no more of her indifference          281.37942057052527
 but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event          817.4997493384545
 she had instinctively turned away but stopping on his approach received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome          780.3410737314853
 he is gone to my father already          282.67377652129096
 you have widely mistaken my character if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these          765.5213329638356
 i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you and will save all the best of the covies for you          548.5602027295397
 you have no regard then for the honour and credit of my nephew          263.6890845994473
 the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr          1291.8819596490257
 forster the delight of mrs          252.1461036170542
 mrs          525.4221105527638
 mrs          525.4221105527638
 you may ask questions which i shall not choose to answer          503.19640133940004
 i thought i understood from the gardiners that you had          221.57869332439486
 lady catherine was generally speakingstating the mistakes of the three others or relating some anecdote of herself          1351.5831277408495
 all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes          278.45161102010985
 bingley and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made her perhaps almost as happy as jane          610.2395926825013
 the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her          504.5942105839609
 wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation though it was only on its being a wet night and on the probability of a rainy season made her feel that the commonest dullest most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker          575.5729034704647
 the express was sent off directly          75.53999005174553
oh my dear lizzy          980.4460572003992
 that tall proud man          1283.439350939523
 he added that mr          153.93799329683398
 their brother indeed was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency          233.05366388618023
 all elizabeths anger against him had been long done away but had she still felt any it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again          462.03616855311384
 collins          829.8333333333333
 and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule          484.447147174793
 i hope my dear said mr          141.37904742647447
 as he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer          167.1294079007083
of what are you thinking          146.6708581454603
 yes vanity is a weakness indeed          933.6090320514012
 colonel fitzwilliams occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was generally different which her own knowledge of him could not have told her and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love and the object of that love her friend eliza she sat herself seriously to work to find it out          351.5264346123855
 bennet regretted that their stay would be so short and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter and having very frequent parties at home          338.9272217813094
 bennet withdrew to the library she saw mr          312.04075929798995
 oh lydia          1974.1836564298292
 i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes          1446.7572729885258
 pray my dear aunt what is the difference in matrimonial affairs between the mercenary and the prudent motive          947.1505827308979
 bingley if she could          210.9534868724826
 his doing so drew her notice          727.3294987743342
my fathers opinion of me does me the greatest honour and i should be miserable to forfeit it          460.8355490803773
 she will be down in a moment i dare say          276.88744061238697
 but you know married women have never much time for writing          492.49673744396665
 there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them for mr          497.86429236206016
 i hope we may often meet again          584.8179313348103
 gardiners door jane was at a drawingroom window watching their arrival when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them and elizabeth looking earnestly in her face was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever          679.8202428347084
 my good qualities are under your protection and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible and in return it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last          308.24482916024743
 i can hardly write for laughing          673.8143630575321
 jones should be sent for early in the morning if miss bennet were not decidedly better          581.2496238248089
 this she would not hear of but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brothers proposal and it was settled that mr          117.74827547628513
 my manners must have been in fault but not intentionally i assure you          433.06615192063276
 their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they had been at first          201.3402091082647
 at such a moment the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought when she saw mr          212.73978027666183
 but consider your daughters          536.0511058107368
 darcy that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton          501.31122897492736
 i rather wished than believed him to be sincere but at any rate was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal          463.84655401650855
 i do not remember her name among the ladies at court          591.3041808074704
 after abusing you so abominably to your face i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations          577.7878966689867
 in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage          315.70383750073705
 you must not disappoint your father          786.1813698058356
 after sitting for a moment in silence she said very stiffly to elizabeth i hope you are well miss bennet          322.8245032423624
 again his astonishment was obvious and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification          461.0711786780906
perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones          1405.666406273513
 and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry          368.88649771890607
 their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this          1234.2970275351342
 and men take care that they should          428.18211994728733
 he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while          832.3944332632126
 elizabeth immediately began playing again          1022.2992655836573
 no one made any reply          492.50176560649163
 collins and maria were gone on business into the village when she was startled by a ring at the door the certain signal of a visitor          513.1226585178657
 how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him          1369.6389845261479
 did you on reading it give any credit to its contents          421.5186432111073
 it was as follows my dear sir i feel myself called upon by our relationship and my situation in life to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire          486.34243757918813
 till i can forget his father i can never defy or expose him          660.7941393991081
 he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity sensible that if such an idea had been suggested his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it          740.5951011940318
 mr          194.34758364312268
 at last she recollected that she had been travelling and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance          537.7520146783356
 collins will be very glad of your company i am sure          213.1523079144981
 collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect that the sight of such rooms so many servants and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them          648.4288262623435
 certainly          1742.65
 all this she must possess added darcy and to all this she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading          247.16463870037805
 bennets manor          17231.385494906925
 but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonishand perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else          519.9232382253492
 darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friends inclination or why upon his own judgment alone he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy          292.5945612221941
 two inferences however were plainly deduced from the whole one that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief and the other that she herself had been barbarously used by them all and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day          409.8825095615607
 but then i have always supposed it to be my own faultbecause i would not take the trouble of practising          292.37641028576775
 your great men often are and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing as he might change his mind another day and warn me off his grounds          474.7424477755759
 collins attending them to point out its beauties and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer          684.5846421577018
 he then handed her in maria followed and the door was on the point of being closed when he suddenly reminded them with some consternation that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings          337.4104894328795
 and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley          172.95050102870533
 gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman and required information and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself          387.1895515250306
 whilst wandering on in this slow manner they were again surprised and elizabeths astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of mr          295.16595130836566
 having resolved to do it without loss of time as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment he set about it in a very orderly manner with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business          411.8651572119948
 cried his wife impatiently          1618.9302552294312
 oh          6970.6
 i will read you the passage which particularly hurts me          1103.2949405261033
 this son was to join in cutting off the entail as soon as he should be of age and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for          407.5055653790596
 can there be any other opinion on the subject          256.4572305406626
the envelope itself was likewise full          1481.8813855305452
 that is a question which mr          34.29719109673376
 collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her ladyship said thanking her for every fish he won and apologising if he thought he won too many          745.9811396179454
 they then sat down and when her enquiries after rosings were made seemed in danger of sinking into total silence          744.7947391661565
 his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece and the kind of halfexpectation which mrs          435.2766287769764
 i have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sir          375.52061681661877
 but i have an aunt too who must not be longer neglected          560.7614180455126
 he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marryingand from that i am inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before          327.0625133363244
it pains me to offend you          822.0651649013038
 you will be censured slighted and despised by every one connected with him          406.9339592413832
 at length however mrs          789.6933622492206
 to no creature had it been revealed where secresy was possible except to elizabeth and from all bingleys connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him of their becoming hereafter her own          458.03519720141065
 certainly said elizabeth though burning with curiosity we will ask you no questions          921.3206841674809
that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certainbut i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears          979.4826239585152
 they contained no actual complaint nor was there any revival of past occurrences or any communication of present suffering          2105.6139166306434
 my mother was taken ill immediately and the whole house in such confusion          324.58365735987564
 they stood for some time without speaking a word and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances and at first was resolved not to break it till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk she made some slight observation on the dance          240.20940452050695
 this accounted to elizabeth for mr          365.9004785208511
 many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter i wish i could hear that you my dearest friend had any intention of making one in the croud but of that i despair          327.9971955338036
 change of scene might be of serviceand perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything          810.1734860362587
 what do you keep winking at me for          761.2201400087398
 good bye          6149.61736579854
 but the fact is that being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father who however may live many years longer i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes placewhich however as i have already said may not be for several years          391.958472691204
 society has claims on us all and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body          1114.5079504826588
 bennet said only nonsense nonsense          2570.3197509314778
 to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love and very lively hopes of mr          428.5413070932505
 they had therefore many acquaintance in common and though wickham had been little there since the death of darcys father five years before it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring          317.2981815412425
 mr          194.34758364312268
 yes indeed and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight          780.6272996532161
 is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year          56.2741231878084
 hate you          1013.3566501717812
i knew how it would bei knew he would manage every thing          505.99405821795335
 she is a great fool for going away if she liked him          246.6128886978552
 be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy          325.02243431552455
 as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce          399.35958263429364
 good gracious          8289.50374597645
 gardiner gave her the particulars also of miss bingleys visit in gracechurchstreet and repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and herself which proved that the former had from her heart given up the acquaintance          528.3175284874378
 though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds or any thing like it has been advanced          927.5673533127976
that would be the greatest misfortune of all          282.86534055324694
 if i were as rich as mr          276.1178196183948
 my father and mother believe the worst but i cannot think so ill of him          94.19034765628267
 i thank you for explaining it so fully          599.7930890569112
 this cannot be          341.92816906918915
 let me thank you again and again in the name of all my family for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble and bear so many mortifications for the sake of discovering them          307.71857759291504
 neither duty nor honour nor gratitude replied elizabeth have any possible claim on me in the present instance          777.4917155071462
 i knew said he that what i wrote must give you pain but it was necessary          262.1618746529958
 they were therefore to go          232.92320727010164
 collins who when i am dead may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases          253.16686423327667
 will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again          424.966064802523
 a great deal more passed at the other table          128.3809763465812
 i believe i have now told you every thing          106.20950091335737
 the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london might be too much she feared for the strength of his attachment          506.6390148700719
 but he is beyond all comparison the most agreeable man i ever sawand if he becomes really attached to mei believe it will be better that he should not          481.32561396678665
 egerton military library whitehall          77670.09983206626
 what is his name          273.81046785292773
 bennets eyes sparkled          14014.375872585082
 elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt          526.3277911880832
oh          6970.6
you mean jane i supposebecause he danced with her twice          343.66639538950545
 bennet invited him to dine with them but with many expressions of concern he confessed himself engaged elsewhere          535.8707536012421
 yours sincerely c          11486.832074648431
 it was a subject in short on which reflection would be long indulged and must be unavailing          299.12516788840617
 for your sake turning to charlotte i am glad of it but otherwise i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line          446.20424517065055
 mr          194.34758364312268
 nor did he seem much more at ease when he spoke his accent had none of its usual sedateness and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn and of her stay in derbyshire so often and in so hurried a way as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts          354.95278692582036
 the garden sloping to the road the house standing in it the green pales and the laurel hedge every thing declared they were arriving          1331.04280483428
 at present indeed they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood it was to remain the whole winter and meryton was the head quarters          455.22829400712334
 it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday senight          262.9871658077511
 every thing however went on smoothly and was finally settled according to charlottes first sketch          1292.5665459481438
 their lodgings were not long a secret and at length they began to know the officers themselves          425.2804380029583
 darcys letter nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend          395.5161003061331
 he is rich to be sure and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane          436.60987095816404
 hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument how frequently mr          561.3577807733205
 she was afraid of talking longer of his friend and having nothing else to say was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him          181.04472968751773
 she had very little notice from any but him          140.84531088467486
 but however insincere you may choose to be you shall not find me so          438.08516633102505
 mrs          525.4221105527638
 on such encouragement to ask elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power by running away          105.88603332324388
 it was the favourite wish of his mother as well as of hers          173.41393936280357
do clear them too or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody          403.2028842379399
 he had been some days in town before he was able to discover them but he had something to direct his search which was more than we had and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us          235.70344109040158
 while i can have my mornings to myself said she it is enough          235.45571985046706
 had the late mr          208.90883165396824
 she felt that she had no business at pemberley and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it          236.89314708593133
 if i had been able said she to carry my point of going to brighton with all my family this would not have happened but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her          275.44828057528224
 our habits of expence make us too dependant and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money          613.3319989437367
 mrs          525.4221105527638
 after walking two or three times along that part of the lane she was tempted by the pleasantness of the morning to stop at the gates and look into the park          276.71340155427407
 it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way          493.0080330539158
 she had dressed with more than usual care and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening          267.904320765559
 instead of viewing them as a stranger i might have rejoiced in them as my own and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt          235.2595716987912
 darcy or at least by the predominance of virtue atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what mr          1253.8644390826719
 who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here collected in one individual          1374.0106620449615
 this was not very consoling to mrs          291.9387531665191
 reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his fathers life time          325.3715143487598
 not that i am afraid of myself but i dread other peoples remarks          497.74887269065886
 darcy          365.59090909090907
 when darcy returned to the saloon miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister          271.24370798746077
 it must be an amusing study          1006.7000793079335
 his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mothers ear          765.6053916566692
 it was necessary to laugh when she would rather have cried          242.34255902353848
 though i know it must be a scandalous falsehood though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible i instantly resolved on setting off for this place that i might make my sentiments known to you          371.88829674828145
we are each of an unsocial taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb          1190.9615118917513
 she was disappointed and angry with herself for being so          150.25408078500826
 forster and kitty and me except my aunt for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns and you cannot imagine how well he looked          415.263889827087
 my reasons for believing it are briefly theseit does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable          627.9061655522892
 it would have suited me in every respect          292.7063842718072
 bennet to walk to oakham mount this morning          1754.1556270079723
 but gracious me          1647.8258600737163
 she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catherines carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlottes observation and hurried her away to her room          695.0266208062077
 and i certainly never shall give it          256.1115710775745
 not that i shall though she added to herself as she finished the letter and my dear aunt if you do not tell me in an honourable manner i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out          267.1208301725062
 she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter          302.09209146949485
 they repulsed every attempt of mrs          1173.0870037323243
 collinss pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much          1099.8614065720124
 but as to your other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good          451.71484483693155
 you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian but never to admit them in your sight or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing          415.22204489918494
 but i have other provocations          857.6413905324965
 the subject was pursued no farther and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away          553.1376697941745
 had they been only ten minutes sooner they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination for it was plain that he was that moment arrived that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage          485.0828114057738
 bennet said she it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house that i should be forced to make way for her and live to see her take my place in it          124.84928811859746
 and your defect is a propensity to hate every body          1094.8208332752852
well that was very decided indeedthat does seem as ifbut however it may all come to nothing you know          700.5217284352542
 the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage explained to her that by his wife at least if not by himself such a hope was cherished          289.90594953602096
 at five oclock the two ladies retired to dress and at half past six elizabeth was summoned to dinner          763.9299296688941
 bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawingroom again and when tea was over glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies          269.07990023865995
 why i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley          167.96041294070082
 collins and charlotte appeared at the door and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party          356.5353951754687
 in point of composition said mary his letter does not seem defective          1591.1053563887738
 who could have done less for her          251.02204982761194
 she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied from the reason of things that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather than by his and she would have wondered why without violently caring for her he chose to elope with her at all had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances and if that were the case he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion          315.0445168185976
 what pinmoney what jewels what carriages you will have          2226.5782221075497
 you take an eager interest in that gentlemans concerns said darcy in a less tranquil tone and with a heightened colour          627.7120874996862
 the marriage of a daughter which had been the first object of her wishes since jane was sixteen was now on the point of accomplishment and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials fine muslins new carriages and servants          396.36418859355985
 it did          184.99480527687206
 if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is i shall know what to think          184.96812418077408
 elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet          524.0438163134257
 chapter iv          38665.93187807582
 and it is the more to be lamented because there is reason to suppose as my dear charlotte informs me that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence though at the same time for the consolation of yourself and mrs          326.98559203641463
 it was an encouragement of vice and had i been the rector of longbourn i should very strenuously have opposed it          433.6623701598446
 elizabeth still more affected was earnest and solemn in her reply and at length by repeated assurances that mr          434.85945510183063
 lady catherine de bourghs attention to his wishes and consideration for his comfort appeared very remarkable          856.4110880231243
 sir william had been delighted with him          519.3603391784873
 her daughter miss de bourgh will have a very large fortune and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates          387.074301733419
 darcy liked me less his son might have borne with me better but his fathers uncommon attachment to me irritated him i believe very early in life          623.9554733390638
 elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could          103.17267093582952
 my avowed one or what i avowed to myself was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley and if she were to make the confession to him which i have since made          211.92885383032956
 she was immediately told that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence mr          361.6173125501014
 care of him          218.0965143798996
 that is capital added her sister and they both laughed heartily          634.8377644729729
 probably notbut mr          6106.265885760821
 elizabeth obeyed and running into her own room for her parasol attended her noble guest down stairs          773.8377701761659
 darcy in wretched suspense could only say something indistinctly of his concern and observe her in compassionate silence          848.1178146889672
 elizabeth said nothing but it gratified her exceedingly the compliment must be all for herself          242.76913918121275
 bennet are not they          237.91379565944248
 oh lord          6968.994986233603
 he found her as handsome as she had been last year as good natured and as unaffected though not quite so chatty          393.9788652187765
 darcy she left elizabeth to walk by herself          194.67058159999644
 bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments          1622.1030363692116
 her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice          3230.412352200658
 his plan did not vary on seeing them          369.73700071243445
 morris immediately that he is to take possession before michaelmas and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week          335.67209607694474
 they were more disturbed more unequal than she had often seen them          699.3397701656612
 pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of cried colonel fitzwilliam          315.15203567874124
 darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and mr          329.2749995976734

 you must decide for yourself said elizabeth and if upon mature deliberation you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife i advise you by all means to refuse him          522.5003346184936
 bennet accompanied by her two youngest girls reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast          750.343183610523
 because you were grave and silent and gave me no encouragement          392.7113008609788
 he is indeedbut considering the inducement my dear miss eliza we cannot wonder at his complaisance for who would object to such a partner          479.4957356777867
 your list of the common extent of accomplishments said darcy has too much truth          639.1050621321968
my mind however is now made up on the subject for having received ordination at easter i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh widow of sir lewis de bourgh whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england          747.8260137114513
 chapter xiv          38665.93187807582
 hayepark might do said she if the gouldings would quit it or the great house at stoke if the drawingroom were larger but ashworth is too far off          847.0308321433755
 she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs          795.9069389430439
 darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley          425.063470383712
 when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring any thing you had a fancy for          499.94592416701926
 wickham so very bad          574.8707358085229
 philipss vulgarity was another and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance and though mrs          792.1770058099114
 you may have drawn him in          278.36467530119614
 do you consider the forms of introduction and the stress that is laid on them as nonsense          586.3298981640046
 next to being married a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then          358.5041036544524
 lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence          618.4404848786061
 mr          194.34758364312268
 lydia has no brothers to step forward and he might imagine from my fathers behaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that he would do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in such a matter          203.99067412232344
 she turned from sister to sister demanding their congratulations and when at length they all sat down looked eagerly round the room took notice of some little alteration in it and observed with a laugh that it was a great while since she had been there          311.0004467309616
 chapter ii          33485.67926741221
 never since reading janes second letter had she entertained a hope of wickhams meaning to marry her          545.7251361285998
