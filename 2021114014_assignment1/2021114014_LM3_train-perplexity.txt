 chapter i      620.1082954481221
 it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife      342.59697802068206
 however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters      700.8511372309157
 bennet replied that he had not      2056.6665453882715
 but it is returned she for mrs      1035.5743332476811
 long has just been here and she told me all about it      87.3091766044505
 bennet made no answer      2056.6665453882724
 do not you want to know who has taken it      82.26417369553651
 cried his wife impatiently      174.1340713518834
 you want to tell me and i have no objection to hearing it      223.12790940200952
 this was invitation enough      266.67016311176104
 long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with mr      406.034213744754
 morris immediately that he is to take possession before michaelmas and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week      789.3552283619787
 what is his name      270.45643337730826
 bingley      40.11910197869102
 single my dear to be sure      182.44256433244362
 a single man of large fortune four or five thousand a year      351.7192020627987
 what a fine thing for our girls      371.399249822332
 how so      40.11910197869102
 how can it affect them      168.68259607116462
 bennet replied his wife how can you be so tiresome      1918.9377394372918
 you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them      246.88546218184018
 is that his design in settling here      437.2476895889022
 design      40.11910197869102
 nonsense how can you talk so      621.4382623065666
 i see no occasion for that      2517.6843954461397
 you and the girls may go or you may send them by themselves which perhaps will be still better for as you are as handsome as any of them mr      122.73195722455884
 bingley might like you the best of the party      244.55606762089144
 my dear you flatter me      193.76542062357612
 i certainly have had my share of beauty but i do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now      204.80420002784584
 but my dear you must indeed go and see mr      873.1690792873802
 bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood      409.89435694249676
 it is more than i engage for i assure you      472.539043355062
 but consider your daughters      1729.4435253892393
 only think what an establishment it would be for one of them      76.21966218932734
 sir william and lady lucas are determined to go merely on that account for in general you know they visit no new comers      132.48035075734214
 indeed you must go for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not      367.9615020452102
 you are over scrupulous surely      40.119101978691035
 i dare say mr      45.693014538637115
 bingley will be very glad to see you and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy      275.9963417199457
 i desire you will do no such thing      356.76718420388704
 lizzy is not a bit better than the others and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane nor half so good humoured as lydia      657.2144837558648
 but you are always giving her the preference      263.40789882134857
 they have none of them much to recommend them replied he they are all silly and ignorant like other girls but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters      602.7821411707893
 bennet how can you abuse your own children in such a way      950.6560965826181
 you take delight in vexing me      132.77524072035618
 you have no compassion on my poor nerves      44.13999885317416
 you mistake me my dear      40.119101978691035
 i have a high respect for your nerves      126.04766112291739
 they are my old friends      814.6955581649441
 i have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least      157.7194590133637
 you do not know what i suffer      40.11910197869101
 it will be no use to us if twenty such should come since you will not visit them      564.4336889099611
 depend upon it my dear that when there are twenty i will visit them all      547.2981152921643
 bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts sarcastic humour reserve and caprice that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character      736.8066849358189
 her mind was less difficult to develope      402.66493359833703
 she was a woman of mean understanding little information and uncertain temper      1212.0017753976174
 when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous      768.6182880412397
 the business of her life was to get her daughters married its solace was visiting and news      1660.2743876192249
 bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr      2779.948540182834
 bingley      40.11910197869102
 he had always intended to visit him though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it      329.7677846461849
 it was then disclosed in the following manner      827.5845652120538
 observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat he suddenly addressed her with i hope mr      776.2262435108217
 bingley will like it lizzy      215.01817017506332
 bingley likes said her mother resentfully since we are not to visit      162.5378466980104
 long has promised to introduce him      40.11910197869101
 long will do any such thing      40.11910197869101
 she has two nieces of her own      448.17423899738384
 she is a selfish hypocritical woman and i have no opinion of her      1073.9182277595978
 no more have i said mr      149.03516866374105
 bennet and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you      511.417423611329
 dont keep coughing so kitty for heavens sake      263.40789882134857
 you tear them to pieces      40.119101978691035
 kitty has no discretion in her coughs said her father she times them ill      226.18920648360066
 i do not cough for my own amusement replied kitty fretfully      132.92534360806295
 when is your next ball to be lizzy      752.1964302304341
 tomorrow fortnight      1454.2828608835578
 aye so it is cried her mother and mrs      283.58780708584544
 long does not come back till the day before so it will be impossible for her to introduce him for she will not know him herself      510.67651706813126
 impossible mr      48.8989988170858
 bennet impossible when i am not acquainted with him myself how can you be so teazing      3749.3341484446682
 a fortnights acquaintance is certainly very little      305.44770441486685
 one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight      183.6302501509263
 but if we do not venture somebody else will and after all mrs      685.3251712070759
 long and her nieces must stand their chance and therefore as she will think it an act of kindness if you decline the office i will take it on myself      560.0205656313051
 the girls stared at their father      493.23587565936685
 bennet said only nonsense nonsense      935.8394474874626
 what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation      430.88827224069234
 cried he      620.1082954481221
 i cannot quite agree with you there      105.387871890059
 what say you mary      270.45643337730826
 mary wished to say something very sensible but knew not how      789.8859080790944
 bingley      40.11910197869102
 i am sick of mr      250.52146603727175
 i am sorry to hear that but why did not you tell me so before      211.08911144850535
 if i had known as much this morning i certainly would not have called on him      104.06249501835366
 it is very unlucky but as i have actually paid the visit we cannot escape the acquaintance now      214.05397310748072
 the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished that of mrs      915.1720610640464
 bennet perhaps surpassing the rest though when the first tumult of joy was over she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while      1755.1380142355997
 how good it was in you my dear mr      89.09673705835279
 but i knew i should persuade you at last      226.42827874660398
 i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance      438.2633120266974
 well how pleased i am      814.6955581649441
 now kitty you may cough as much as you chuse said mr      252.2510100098297
 bennet and as he spoke he left the room fatigued with the raptures of his wife      516.9698825071828
 what an excellent father you have girls said she when the door was shut      922.2365934148668
 at our time of life it is not so pleasant i can tell you to be making new acquaintance every day but for your sakes we would do any thing      510.1754368000992
 lydia my love though you are the youngest i dare say mr      86.06110713591987
 bingley will dance with you at the next ball      244.55606762089144
 said lydia stoutly i am not afraid for though i am the youngest im the tallest      215.31572639816605
 the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return mr      1295.5108024037818
 bennets visit and determining when they should ask him to dinner      1490.5735665587868
 bingley      40.11910197869102
 they attacked him in various ways with barefaced questions ingenious suppositions and distant surmises but he eluded the skill of them all and they were at last obliged to accept the secondhand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas      481.7933592893735
 her report was highly favourable      193.76542062357612
 sir william had been delighted with him      433.7392549148117
 he was quite young wonderfully handsome extremely agreeable and to crown the whole he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party      362.30776208935185
 nothing could be more delightful      168.68259607116462
 to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love and very lively hopes of mr      360.13805377378503
 bingleys heart were entertained      327.15695039771015
 if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield said mrs      456.4459202145
 bennet to her husband and all the others equally well married i shall have nothing to wish for      793.8852498827382
 bennets visit and sat about ten minutes with him in his library      2147.814415751189
 the ladies were somewhat more fortunate for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse      1589.6700335423443
 an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched and already had mrs      169.9870285714277
 bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping when an answer arrived which deferred it all      907.1744158942043
 bingley was obliged to be in town the following day and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation c      414.67956000523384
 bennet was quite disconcerted      2056.6665453882724
 she could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another and never settled at netherfield as he ought to be      541.3110538686823
 lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball and a report soon followed that mr      346.28412825881986
 bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly      696.6101301324896
 the girls grieved over such a number of ladies but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing that instead of twelve he had brought only six with him from london his five sisters and a cousin      392.9948293035177
 and when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether mr      531.1439655864771
 bingley his two sisters the husband of the eldest and another young man      282.11101588223966
 his sisters were fine women with an air of decided fashion      1792.8707847316095
 hurst merely looked the gentleman but his friend mr      1327.9590928053851
 darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine tall person handsome features noble mien and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance of his having ten thousand a year      514.3133096461837
 bingley and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity for he was discovered to be proud to be above his company and above being pleased and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding disagreeable countenance and being unworthy to be compared with his friend      330.53496964721563
 bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room he was lively and unreserved danced every dance was angry that the ball closed so early and talked of giving one himself at netherfield      335.7920502200688
 such amiable qualities must speak for themselves      318.18265847388284
 what a contrast between him and his friend      292.3898369722014
 darcy danced only once with mrs      113.50930596523533
 hurst and once with miss bingley declined being introduced to any other lady and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room speaking occasionally to one of his own party      552.4207020255801
 his character was decided      327.15695039771015
 he was the proudest most disagreeable man in the world and every body hoped that he would never come there again      1175.9057037015784
 amongst the most violent against him was mrs      845.6522872991771
 bennet whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters      985.8271866093645
 elizabeth bennet had been obliged by the scarcity of gentlemen to sit down for two dances and during part of that time mr      899.4379870566893
 darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and mr      272.05180703455585
 bingley who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it      580.9330377920927
 come darcy said he i must have you dance      461.7300360309637
 i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner      867.6540528462575
 you had much better dance      40.119101978691035
 you know how i detest it unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner      111.90895152746809
 at such an assembly as this it would be insupportable      378.37579217633
 your sisters are engaged and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with      516.3197152755429
 i would not be so fastidious as you are cried bingley for a kingdom      203.82912520559634
 you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room said mr      126.00679405675851
 darcy looking at the eldest miss bennet      97.83758319273011
 she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld      1519.6478732850962
 but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you who is very pretty and i dare say very agreeable      648.1406542466817
 do let me ask my partner to introduce you      512.5999343888922
 which do you mean      266.67016311176104
 you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles for you are wasting your time with me      681.0011710182958
 darcy walked off and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him      218.9202388425489
 she told the story however with great spirit among her friends for she had a lively playful disposition which delighted in any thing ridiculous      725.4790583395048
 the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family      908.4229569747469
 bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party      556.9222470831662
 bingley had danced with her twice and she had been distinguished by his sisters      135.43005823001494
 jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be though in a quieter way      668.7882400577374
 elizabeth felt janes pleasure      317.1260553314424
 mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball      661.6875617060969
 they found mr      439.4232093657577
 bennet still up      7640.1422354822
 with a book he was regardless of time and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations      574.1981825573338
 he had rather hoped that all his wifes views on the stranger would be disappointed but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear      297.44818100388903
 i wish you had been there      586.6595363047983
 jane was so admired nothing could be like it      607.4670826706682
 every body said how well she looked and mr      553.6385512922801
 only think of that my dear he actually danced with her twice and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time      217.21207283927268
 first of all he asked miss lucas      1003.0832775258281
 i was so vexed to see him stand up with her but however he did not admire her at all indeed nobody can you know and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance      1048.8754299428717
 so he enquired who she was and got introduced and asked her for the two next      309.88215689268594
 for gods sake say no more of his partners      193.02102445872364
 that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance      400.1452849507138
 my dear continued mrs      287.24835050978845
 bennet i am quite delighted with him      3269.027341569461
 he is so excessively handsome      209.72769367027806
 and his sisters are charming women      45.567935788034156
 i never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses      267.4631107053323
 hursts gown here she was interrupted again      1171.9387903957215
 bennet protested against any description of finery      3269.027341569461
 she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject and related with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration the shocking rudeness of mr      1108.3778306298948
 but i can assure you she added that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy for he is a most disagreeable horrid man not at all worth pleasing      418.1943822434271
 he walked here and he walked there fancying himself so very great      288.95205448290636
 not handsome enough to dance with      132.77524072035618
 i wish you had been there my dear to have given him one of your set downs      179.02867883018428
 i quite detest the man      44.519480662564156
 chapter iv      620.1082954481221
 when jane and elizabeth were alone the former who had been cautious in her praise of mr      268.72145179853885
 bingley before expressed to her sister how very much she admired him      974.4969238194847
 he is just what a young man ought to be said she sensible good humoured lively and i never saw such happy manners      331.9108089790888
so much ease with such perfect good breeding      621.1055034158809
 he is also handsome replied elizabeth which a young man ought likewise to be if he possibly can      290.3133209809008
 his character is thereby complete      246.99101837456777
 i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time      417.0930697981887
 i did not expect such a compliment      46.550145278360745
 did not you      45.77732164701818
 but that is one great difference between us      683.9145616261229
 compliments always take you by surprise and me never      2585.492393450063
 what could be more natural than his asking you again      314.8316861251804
 he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room      364.8527949304309
 no thanks to his gallantry for that      119.37693132615247
 you have liked many a stupider person      42.79635557662758
 dear lizzy      40.11910197869102
 you are a great deal too apt you know to like people in general      137.80852986475443
 you never see a fault in any body      107.35057460168989
 i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life      272.52512271577126
 i know you do and it is that which makes the wonder      76.21966218932734
 with your good sense to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others      101.69515810627114
 affectation of candour is common enoughone meets it every where      2719.8608571102777
 and so you like this mans sisters too do you      102.00034256777222
 certainly not at first      1129.316601208846
 miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her      732.8281161726462
 elizabeth listened in silence but was not convinced their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself she was very little disposed to approve them      779.5475002829653
 they were in fact very fine ladies not deficient in good humour when they were pleased nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it but proud and conceited      550.2585366128276
 they were rather handsome had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds were in the habit of spending more than they ought and of associating with people of rank and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves and meanly of others      630.6741579276816
 they were of a respectable family in the north of england a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brothers fortune and their own had been acquired by trade      1797.227253737769
 bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father who had intended to purchase an estate but did not live to do it      595.346853151733
 bingley intended it likewise and sometimes made choice of his county but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield and leave the next generation to purchase      761.7505022285534
 his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own but though he was now established only as a tenant miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table nor was mrs      773.6609700769886
 hurst who had married a man of more fashion than fortune less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her      223.0918096866233
 bingley had not been of age two years when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house      391.39586017881373
 he did look at it and into it for half an hour was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms satisfied with what the owner said in its praise and took it immediately      157.37993870286616
 between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship in spite of a great opposition of character      852.6072670070105
bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness openness ductility of his temper though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied      432.4523252953353
 on the strength of darcys regard bingley had the firmest reliance and of his judgment the highest opinion      512.5999343888922
 in understanding darcy was the superior      43.75391731724056
 he was at the same time haughty reserved and fastidious and his manners though well bred were not inviting      1818.5584141053232
 in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage      228.2206770626403
 the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic      468.9615049624668
 bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life every body had been most kind and attentive to him there had been no formality no stiffness he had soon felt acquainted with all the room and as to miss bennet he could not conceive an angel more beautiful      849.3013896999473
 darcy on the contrary had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest and from none received either attention or pleasure      239.0310583782504
 miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty but she smiled too much      4385.8256788502795
 hurst and her sister allowed it to be sobut still they admired her and liked her and pronounced her to be a sweet girl and one whom they should not object to know more of      492.9077549005129
 miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose      2816.8777297855427
 within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate      294.8618968623331
 the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly      752.1964302304341
 it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town and quitting them both he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton denominated from that period lucas lodge where he could think with pleasure of his own importance and unshackled by business occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world      486.57376797046504
 for though elated by his rank it did not render him supercilious on the contrary he was all attention to every body      310.4006458090206
 by nature inoffensive friendly and obliging his presentation at st      428.8650975691982
 jamess had made him courteous      1090.363061731885
 lady lucas was a very good kind of woman not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to mrs      226.03141501898946
they had several children      1729.4435253892393
 the eldest of them a sensible intelligent young woman about twentyseven was elizabeths intimate friend      1356.7808494081148
 that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate      1330.3160497328804
 you began the evening well charlotte said mrs      287.24835050978845
 you were mr      40.11910197869101
 bingleys first choice      631.7212696375212
 yesbut he seemed to like his second better      2056.6665453882724
you mean jane i supposebecause he danced with her twice      209.1515882498129
 to be sure that did seem as if he admired herindeed i rather believe he didi heard something about itbut i hardly know whatsomething about mr      1148.135685430064
 perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr      1082.6528877142478
 robinson did not i mention it to you      334.29939977041204
 robinsons asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room and which he thought the prettiest      271.06052549143936
 and his answering immediately to the last questionoh      126.04766112291739
 the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt there cannot be two opinions on that point      2643.3156348415523
 upon my word      553.6385512922801
well that was very decided indeedthat does seem as ifbut however it may all come to nothing you know      708.9467093601821
 my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours eliza said charlotte      306.1340377639357
 darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend is he      226.62061523577813
to be only just tolerable      3934.7796865402333
 i beg you would not put it into lizzys head to be vexed by his illtreatment for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him      232.41164320391175
 long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips      288.2693636536264
 are you quite sure maam      225.75951233528167
is not there a little mistake      603.7985448863138
 said jane      2056.6665453882724
i certainly saw mr      1286.2172215412006
 darcy speaking to her      48.56388609578208
 ayebecause she asked him at last how he liked netherfield and he could not help answering herbut she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to      1106.4340163329089
 miss bingley told me said jane that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance      856.5927458509731
 with them he is remarkably agreeable      479.2352226647013
 i do not believe a word of it my dear      86.65830354848481
 if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to mrs      441.2530549177968
 long      40.11910197869102
 but i can guess how it was every body says that he is ate up with pride and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs      708.4875555269391
 long does not keep a carriage and had come to the ball in a hack chaise      175.60260670221672
 i do not mind his not talking to mrs      94.40006465262863
 long said miss lucas but i wish he had danced with eliza      175.73632566154058
 another time lizzy said her mother i would not dance with him if i were you      478.5906212460877
 i believe maam i may safely promise you never to dance with him      929.9657489617161
 his pride said miss lucas does not offend me so much as pride often does because there is an excuse for it      634.3376408526318
 one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man with family fortune every thing in his favour should think highly of himself      376.1249903861735
 if i may so express it he has a right to be proud      264.3503933598611
 that is very true replied elizabeth and i could easily forgive his pride if he had not mortified mine      479.629298334242
 pride observed mary who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections is a very common failing i believe      809.8732199005003
 by all that i have ever read i am convinced that it is very common indeed that human nature is particularly prone to it and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of selfcomplacency on the score of some quality or other real or imaginary      292.6015799861964
 vanity and pride are different things though the words are often used synonimously      149.53027266430868
 pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves vanity to what we would have others think of us      920.8667821812745
 if i were as rich as mr      317.76035737192564
 darcy cried a young lucas who came with his sisters i should not care how proud i was      127.93984281430077
 i would keep a pack of foxhounds and drink a bottle of wine every day      333.688726412999
 then you would drink a great deal more than you ought said mrs      221.9132379499782
 bennet and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly      394.82799943350227
 the boy protested that she should not she continued to declare that she would and the argument ended only with the visit      1335.3761000220509
 chapter vi      620.1082954481221
 the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield      451.7728694881259
 the visit was returned in due form      364.7031591292685
 hurst and miss bingley and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to a wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the two eldest      266.35292890091563
 by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body hardly excepting even her sister and could not like them though their kindness to jane such as it was had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brothers admiration      1039.200766261582
 it was generally evident whenever they met that he did admire her and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first and was in a way to be very much in love but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general since jane united with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent      504.2339833005086
 she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas      2242.810771259853
 it may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte to be able to impose on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded      1370.7824300716377
 if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark      650.1019866598419
 there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself      619.0127512309242
 we can all begin freelya slight preference is natural enough but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement      483.04451828460185
 in nine cases out of ten a woman had better shew more affection than she feels      493.7597633094639
 bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but he may never do more than like her if she does not help him on      284.05717173574186
 if i can perceive her regard for him he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too      588.7813760988686
 remember eliza that he does not know janes disposition as you do      3963.9910365342907
 but if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavour to conceal it he must find it out      572.9108866089746
 perhaps he must if he sees enough of her      1561.3654889374807
 but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often it is never for many hours together and as they always see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together      473.10602890830506
 jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention      267.6020644950683
 when she is secure of him there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses      1629.0912573494538
 your plan is a good one replied elizabeth where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married and if i were determined to get a rich husband or any husband i dare say i should adopt it      264.3205383916736
 but these are not janes feelings she is not acting by design      2015.7831381563951
 as yet she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness      817.0007640509018
 she has known him only a fortnight      448.17423899738384
 she danced four dances with him at meryton she saw him one morning at his own house and has since dined in company with him four times      630.6707700365359
 this is not quite enough to make her understand his character      402.1911977258977
 not as you represent it      168.68259607116462
 had she merely dined with him she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent togetherand four evenings may do a great deal      590.577936712263
 yes these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingtun better than commerce but with respect to any other leading characteristic i do not imagine that much has been unfolded      859.3540787805804
 happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance      1531.6773525715266
 they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life      606.9557275458312
 you make me laugh charlotte but it is not sound      209.1515882498129
 you know it is not sound and that you would never act in this way yourself      179.45926618819493
 occupied in observing mr      620.1082954481221
 bingleys attentions to her sister elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend      842.5257440267031
 darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty he had looked at her without admiration at the ball and when they next met he looked at her only to criticise      319.56644982696645
 but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes      327.12502144312083
 though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world he was caught by their easy playfulness      505.66780711365226
 of this she was perfectly unawareto her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with      1178.7121679448785
 he began to wish to know more of her and as a step towards conversing with her himself attended to her conversation with others      397.0997130796644
 his doing so drew her notice      182.44256433244362
 it was at sir william lucass where a large party were assembled      1127.6243859122649
 what does mr      439.4232093657577
 darcy mean said she to charlotte by listening to my conversation with colonel forster      388.09562873019894
 that is a question which mr      499.1041075342648
 but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about      606.2321677382917
 he has a very satirical eye and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself i shall soon grow afraid of him      342.5411006377802
 on his approaching them soon afterwards though without seeming to have any intention of speaking miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it she turned to him and said did not you think mr      458.5769750248036
 darcy that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton      1346.305325318987
 with great energybut it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic      779.8916897979148
 you are severe on us      40.119101978691035
 it will be her turn soon to be teazed said miss lucas      537.9233496542191
 i am going to open the instrument eliza and you know what follows      146.75282584176244
always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body      504.8891299852108
if my vanity had taken a musical turn you would have been invaluable but as it is i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers      258.8962543744688
 on miss lucass persevering however she added very well if it must be so it must      852.6020622457207
 and gravely glancing at mr      46.74347398462845
 darcy there is a fine old saying which every body here is of course familiar withkeep your breath to cool your porridgeand i shall keep mine to swell my song      327.736438445686
 her performance was pleasing though by no means capital      1110.5071604184259
 elizabeth easy and unaffected had been listened to with much more pleasure though not playing half so well and mary at the end of a long concerto was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs at the request of her younger sisters who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room      785.8342131075981
 what a charming amusement for young people this is mr      339.8312607715938
there is nothing like dancing after all      1123.2008772230677
i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies      280.8996416747814
 certainly sirand it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world      216.885131950089
every savage can dance      2056.6665453882724
 sir william only smiled      389.0573731355492
 your friend performs delightfully he continued after a pause on seeing bingley join the groupand i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself mr      360.87277766219074
 you saw me dance at meryton i believe sir      251.26965977195474
 yes indeed and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight      1056.583417254731
 do you often dance at st      40.11910197869101
 jamess      40.11910197869102
 never sir      40.11910197869102
 it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it      765.135202857344
 you have a house in town i conclude      44.13999885317416
 darcy bowed      40.11910197869102
 i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myselffor i am fond of superior society but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas      482.8481892368596
 darcy you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner      238.6620494172591
you cannot refuse to dance i am sure when so much beauty is before you      251.93106046684431
 and taking her hand he would have given it to mr      92.84125176097395
 darcy who though extremely surprised was not unwilling to receive it when she instantly drew back and said with some discomposure to sir william indeed sir i have not the least intention of dancing      459.35329402237113
i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner      342.0320220220586
 darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand but in vain      157.55091595190243
 elizabeth was determined nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion      1111.883860281331
 darcy is all politeness said elizabeth smiling      97.83758319273011
 he is indeedbut considering the inducement my dear miss eliza we cannot wonder at his complaisance for who would object to such a partner      764.0320414159444
 elizabeth looked archly and turned away      175.26129507828713
 her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman and he was thinking of her with some complacency when thus accosted by miss bingley i can guess the subject of your reverie      369.35375932744563
 i should imagine not      327.15695039771015
 you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this mannerin such society and indeed i am quite of your opinion      189.22306772836018
 i was never more annoyed      204.90236923837804
 the insipidity and yet the noise the nothingness and yet the selfimportance of all these people      512.4698993559299
what would i give to hear your strictures on them      373.34875226691275
 your conjecture is totally wrong i assure you      79.54818731699979
 my mind was more agreeably engaged      591.3926348396952
 miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections      1236.6044264233024
 darcy replied with great intrepidity miss elizabeth bennet      87.52082483823872
 miss elizabeth bennet      631.7212696375212
 repeated miss bingley      553.6385512922801
 how long has she been such a favourite      98.44091095009432
and pray when am i to wish you joy      114.03909965182777
 that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask      1373.0880134428508
 a ladys imagination is very rapid it jumps from admiration to love from love to matrimony in a moment      177.35290652911442
 i knew you would be wishing me joy      281.1111668884079
 nay if you are so serious about it i shall consider the matter as absolutely settled      110.33784926613245
 you will have a charming motherinlaw indeed and of course she will be always at pemberley with you      140.64913751473057
 he listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to entertain herself in this manner and as his composure convinced her that all was safe her wit flowed long      1113.9178294192625
 chapter vii      620.1082954481221
 bennets property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year which unfortunately for his daughters was entailed in default of heirs male on a distant relation and their mothers fortune though ample for her situation in life could but ill supply the deficiency of his      1060.126216967297
 her father had been an attorney in meryton and had left her four thousand pounds      311.0506797300221
 she had a sister married to a mr      344.6413693781092
 philips who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of trade      557.1574645625058
 the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton a most convenient distance for the young ladies who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliners shop just over the way      266.8687819387636
 the two youngest of the family catherine and lydia were particularly frequent in these attentions their minds were more vacant than their sisters and when nothing better offered a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening and however bare of news the country in general might be they always contrived to learn some from their aunt      517.8796155123183
 at present indeed they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood it was to remain the whole winter and meryton was the head quarters      1298.9562159082227
 their visits to mrs      1729.4435253892393
 philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence      671.26667243744
 every day added something to their knowledge of the officers names and connections      151.53086129261172
 their lodgings were not long a secret and at length they began to know the officers themselves      261.1252498653726
 they could talk of nothing but officers and mr      392.7066430717222
 bingleys large fortune the mention of which gave animation to their mother was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign      478.5695393175948
 after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject mr      1310.7815137036903
 bennet coolly observed from all that i can collect by your manner of talking you must be two of the silliest girls in the country      797.2358872077895
 i have suspected it some time but i am now convinced      411.2024525935517
 catherine was disconcerted and made no answer but lydia with perfect indifference continued to express her admiration of captain carter and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day as he was going the next morning to london      544.0967053481136
 i am astonished my dear said mrs      158.34946572967354
 bennet that you should be so ready to think your own children silly      1373.087490035095
 if i wished to think slightingly of any bodys children it should not be of my own however      511.22562890138033
 if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it      307.86500019850484
 yesbut as it happens they are all of them very clever      1641.5753181325633
 this is the only point i flatter myself on which we do not agree      719.3345061839071
 i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish      321.3219274022784
 bennet you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother      1203.9901222846777
when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do      549.558691034538
 i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very welland indeed so i do still at my heart and if a smart young colonel with five or six thousand a year should want one of my girls i shall not say nay to him and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir williams in his regimentals      740.258225186765
 mama cried lydia my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss watsons as they did when they first came she sees them now very often standing in clarkes library      418.4064695597912
 bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet it came from netherfield and the servant waited for an answer      1737.1193999352604
 bennets eyes sparkled with pleasure and she was eagerly calling out while her daughter read well jane who is it from      2748.2446284715325
 what is it about      270.45643337730826
 well jane make haste and tell us make haste my love      345.76260499920585
 it is from miss bingley said jane and then read it aloud      528.0129348916532
 my dear friend if you are not so compassionate as to dine today with louisa and me we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives for a whole days têteàtête between two women can never end without a quarrel      437.74087448774407
 come as soon as you can on the receipt of this      1405.9022132152481
 yours ever caroline bingley      40.11910197869102
 i wonder my aunt did not tell us of that      190.4463786675954
 dining out said mrs      45.693014538637115
 bennet that is very unlucky      935.8394474874626
 can i have the carriage      139.75505364770575
 said jane      2056.6665453882724
 no my dear you had better go on horseback because it seems likely to rain and then you must stay all night      179.99869314869713
 that would be a good scheme said elizabeth if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home      254.76988506941115
 but the gentlemen will have mr      1632.3773188485725
 bingleys chaise to go to meryton and the hursts have no horses to theirs      379.86415955146487
 but my dear your father cannot spare the horses i am sure      556.9222470831662
 they are wanted in the farm mr      367.6531739013711
 bennet are not they      2056.6665453882724
 they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them      457.3882398981207
 but if you have got them today said elizabeth my mothers purpose will be answered      181.0502651265792
 she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged      375.46038124611107
 jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day      756.5898663362682
 her hopes were answered jane had not been gone long before it rained hard      1171.9387903957215
 her sisters were uneasy for her but her mother was delighted      1605.6011806174731
 the rain continued the whole evening without intermission jane certainly could not come back      318.3050266354209
 this was a lucky idea of mine indeed      795.9392178931464
 said mrs      2056.6665453882724
 till the next morning however she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance      1064.8752862206225
 breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth my dearest lizzy i find myself very unwell this morning which i suppose is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday      1050.9342464587066
 my kind friends will not hear of my returning home till i am better      208.20279537842984
 they insist also on my seeing mr      364.7031591292685
 yours c      40.11910197869102
 well my dear said mr      814.6955581649441
 bennet when elizabeth had read the note aloud if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness if she should die it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr      638.7222393864523
 bingley and under your orders      215.01817017506332
 i am not at all afraid of her dying      246.49196487810062
 people do not die of little trifling colds      2056.6665453882724
 as long as she stays there it is all very well      205.49620139972419
 i would go and see her if i could have the carriage      76.21966218932734
 elizabeth feeling really anxious was determined to go to her though the carriage was not to be had and as she was no horsewoman walking was her only alternative      460.88656817933
 she declared her resolution      2445.8024889638004
 how can you be so silly cried her mother as to think of such a thing in all this dirt      392.42947826010516
 you will not be fit to be seen when you get there      76.21966218932734
 i shall be very fit to see janewhich is all i want      338.7117961722403
 is this a hint to me lizzy said her father to send for the horses      382.44892687638463
 no indeed      40.11910197869102
 i do not wish to avoid the walk      42.81544943112701
 the distance is nothing when one has a motive only three miles      917.9383034404899
 i shall be back by dinner      196.7241522629276
 i admire the activity of your benevolence observed mary but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason and in my opinion exertion should always be in proportion to what is required      404.577760284448
elizabeth accepted their company and the three young ladies set off together      978.2898970583927
 if we make haste said lydia as they walked along perhaps we may see something of captain carter before he goes      1264.6631591559076
 in meryton they parted the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers wives and elizabeth continued her walk alone crossing field after field at a quick pace jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity and finding herself at last within view of the house with weary ancles dirty stockings and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise      555.078321393825
 she was shewn into the breakfastparlour where all but jane were assembled and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise      1032.6714847438752
that she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such dirty weather and by herself was almost incredible to mrs      426.2654480533287
 hurst and miss bingley and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it      555.2366011913273
 she was received however very politely by them and in their brothers manners there was something better than politeness there was good humour and kindness      1226.4345835746508
 darcy said very little and mr      113.50930596523533
 the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to the occasions justifying her coming so far alone      1095.6774091601203
 her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered      201.58862760690135
 miss bennet had slept ill and though up was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room      1271.279384881453
 elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately and jane who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit was delighted at her entrance      689.1960023603862
 she was not equal however to much conversation and when miss bingley left them together could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with      556.2639535303587
 elizabeth silently attended her      317.1260553314424
 when breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters and elizabeth began to like them herself when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for jane      1018.2037418129916
 the apothecary came and having examined his patient said as might be supposed that she had caught a violent cold and that they must endeavour to get the better of it advised her to return to bed and promised her some draughts      441.25575231059764
 the advice was followed readily for the feverish symptoms increased and her head ached acutely      833.5864627182634
 elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment nor were the other ladies often absent the gentlemen being out they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere      289.7809058206626
 when the clock struck three elizabeth felt that she must go and very unwillingly said so      522.285391316768
 miss bingley offered her the carriage and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it when jane testified such concern in parting with her that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present      580.7578638744984
 elizabeth most thankfully consented and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes      657.6015432607032
 chapter viii      620.1082954481221
 at five oclock the two ladies retired to dress and at half past six elizabeth was summoned to dinner      518.1766140138466
 to the civil enquiries which then poured in and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of mr      409.21888055834603
 bingleys she could not make a very favourable answer      586.5929186828645
 the sisters on hearing this repeated three or four times how much they were grieved how shocking it was to have a bad cold and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves and then thought no more of the matter and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike      838.8201429391511
 their brother indeed was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency      398.3782823275305
 she had very little notice from any but him      271.38624312485604
 darcy her sister scarcely less so and as for mr      164.55909805999227
 hurst by whom elizabeth sat he was an indolent man who lived only to eat drink and play at cards who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout had nothing to say to her      773.122265456055
 her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed a mixture of pride and impertinence she had no conversation no style no taste no beauty      513.9315449001874
 hurst thought the same and added she has nothing in short to recommend her but being an excellent walker      432.2169996319127
 i shall never forget her appearance this morning      137.4559491389114
 she really looked almost wild      1074.9972338701825
 she did indeed louisa      2445.8024889638004
 i could hardly keep my countenance      108.9906027572228
 very nonsensical to come at all      149.03516866374105
 why must she be scampering about the country because her sister had a cold      1171.9387903957215
 her hair so untidy so blowsy      149.03516866374105
 yes and her petticoat i hope you saw her petticoat six inches deep in mud i am absolutely certain and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office      494.5133902175914
 your picture may be very exact louisa said bingley but this was all lost upon me      411.6059848804489
 i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning      501.4566931804587
 certainly not      620.1082954481221
 to walk three miles or four miles or five miles or whatever it is above her ancles in dirt and alone quite alone      617.822397626114
 what could she mean by it      499.1041075342648
 it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence a most country town indifference to decorum      2507.2912469672706
 it shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing said bingley      915.1720610640464
 darcy observed miss bingley in a half whisper that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes      948.6955865426667
 not at all he replied they were brightened by the exercise      170.10015471249133
 hurst began again      40.11910197869101
 i have an excessive regard for jane bennet she is really a very sweet girl and i wish with all my heart she were well settled      641.9391929257432
 but with such a father and mother and such low connections i am afraid there is no chance of it      764.7391548812687
 i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in meryton      127.80702688219023
 yes and they have another who lives somewhere near cheapside      459.6462305827048
 if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside cried bingley it would not make them one jot less agreeable      371.631778992742
 but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world replied darcy      1055.3597730899849
 to this speech bingley made no answer but his sisters gave it their hearty assent and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friends vulgar relations      829.4093493389558
 with a renewal of tenderness however they repaired to her room on leaving the diningparlour and sat with her till summoned to coffee      560.693266570832
 she was still very poorly and elizabeth would not quit her at all till late in the evening when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself      436.2666404914298
 on entering the drawingroom she found the whole party at loo and was immediately invited to join them but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it and making her sister the excuse said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book      404.4396885856078
 hurst looked at her with astonishment      553.6385512922801
 do you prefer reading to cards      40.11910197869101
 said he that is rather singular      207.22126484587707
 she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else      358.8526476686366
 i deserve neither such praise nor such censure cried elizabeth i am not a great reader and i have pleasure in many things      849.0386924992619
 in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure said bingley and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well      221.4898902462668
 elizabeth thanked him from her heart and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying      574.3887087426256
 he immediately offered to fetch her others all that his library afforded      1170.6554339018671
 and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit but i am an idle fellow and though i have not many i have more than i ever look into      371.2090345766737
 elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room      1356.6080083412924
 i am astonished said miss bingley that my father should have left so small a collection of books      663.6403842801517
what a delightful library you have at pemberley mr      562.4384103917047
 it ought to be good he replied it has been the work of many generations      498.98399965739384
 and then you have added so much to it yourself you are always buying books      115.17437015817539
 i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these      494.5604718853261
 neglect      40.11910197869102
 i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place      198.70579925585884
 charles when you build your house i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley      424.2654269081945
 i wish it may      275.1051068147718
 but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood and take pemberley for a kind of model      182.7909633198554
 there is not a finer county in england than derbyshire      985.8271866093645
 with all my heart i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it      215.26317147376093
 i am talking of possibilities charles      184.61315922261164
 upon my word caroline i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation      202.8266245151127
 elizabeth was so much caught by what passed as to leave her very little attention for her book and soon laying it wholly aside she drew near the cardtable and stationed herself between mr      737.5927839409603
 bingley and his eldest sister to observe the game      244.55606762089144
 is miss darcy much grown since the spring      2785.6079317581994
 said miss bingley will she be as tall as i am      1000.4799828481487
 she is now about miss elizabeth bennets height or rather taller      784.806598795149
 i never met with anybody who delighted me so much      448.57829369731706
 such a countenance such manners      665.4705023792866
 and so extremely accomplished for her age      152.15295271847975
 her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite      1171.9387903957215
 it is amazing to me said bingley how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are      547.9187242363909
 all young ladies accomplished      48.563886095782074
 my dear charles what do you mean      405.92201397339835
 yes all of them i think      670.0843949619172
 they all paint tables cover skreens and net purses      232.64422394788394
 i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time without being informed that she was very accomplished      220.37138621984758
 the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a skreen      716.331354552417
 but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general      440.9093794138012
 i cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished      335.38539249186357
 nor i i am sure said miss bingley      44.98706892045387
 a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word and besides all this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the word will be but half deserved      356.10528679091743
 all this she must possess added darcy and to all this she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading      2119.5547939336034
 i rather wonder now at your knowing any      309.285252463012
 are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this      537.4690185051979
 i never saw such capacity and taste and application and elegance as you describe united      631.6617021627955
 hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description when mr      503.52783091603584
 as all conversation was thereby at an end elizabeth soon afterwards left the room      214.11742151907248
 undoubtedly replied darcy to whom this remark was chiefly addressed there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation      338.4255402589971
 miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject      1050.5158389977032
 elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse and that she could not leave her      492.9469093201721
 bingley urged mr      631.7212696375212
 joness being sent for immediately while his sisters convinced that no country advice could be of any service recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians      993.38308313083
 jones should be sent for early in the morning if miss bennet were not decidedly better      512.4044326042733
 bingley was quite uncomfortable his sisters declared that they were miserable      352.37771914709464
 they solaced their wretchedness however by duets after supper while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister      1339.9892618827216
 chapter ix      620.1082954481221
 elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sisters room and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from mr      1196.8915699547272
 bingley by a housemaid and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters      247.89013676681157
 in spite of this amendment however she requested to have a note sent to longbourn desiring her mother to visit jane and form her own judgment of her situation      1044.017156629806
 the note was immediately dispatched and its contents as quickly complied with      931.7584972507266
 bennet accompanied by her two youngest girls reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast      2575.4540498364736
 had she found jane in any apparent danger mrs      271.38624312485604
 bennet would have been very miserable but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming she had no wish of her recovering immediately as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield      818.7914384526935
 she would not listen therefore to her daughters proposal of being carried home neither did the apothecary who arrived about the same time think it at all advisable      809.806624027234
 after sitting a little while with jane on miss bingleys appearance and invitation the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour      864.3781759717551
 bingley met them with hopes that mrs      409.89435694249676
 bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected      913.5603807137087
 indeed i have sir was her answer      409.89435694249676
 she is a great deal too ill to be moved      556.1976443711081
 we must trespass a little longer on your kindness      2949.1393446137768
 removed      40.11910197869102
 cried bingley      620.1082954481221
 it must not be thought of      537.9233496542191
 you may depend upon it madam said miss bingley with cold civility that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us      372.49361970887924
 bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments      2056.6665453882715
 i am sure she added if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her for she is very ill indeed and suffers a vast deal though with the greatest patience in the world which is always the way with her for she has without exception the sweetest temper i ever met with      367.62044692634083
 you have a sweet room here mr      42.79635557662758
 bingley and a charming prospect over that gravel walk      244.55606762089144
 i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield      116.14680998069532
 you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope though you have but a short lease      131.6891168783049
 whatever i do is done in a hurry replied he and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield i should probably be off in five minutes      249.34091784125786
 at present however i consider myself as quite fixed here      2219.978534270396
 that is exactly what i should have supposed of you said elizabeth      1062.189169474548
 yesi understand you perfectly      2056.6665453882724
 i wish i might take this for a compliment but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is pitiful      407.9119090634351
 i did not know before continued bingley immediately that you were a studier of character      112.02024274346924
 it must be an amusing study      537.9233496542191
 yes but intricate characters are the most amusing      2056.6665453882724
 they have at least that advantage      493.23587565936685
 in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society      117.24522274403363
 but people themselves alter so much that there is something new to be observed in them for ever      4746.771962619018
 yes indeed cried mrs      2056.6665453882724
 bennet offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood      1633.6683064147535
 i assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town      398.99028615366916
 every body was surprised and darcy after looking at her for a moment turned silently away      492.86126306651283
 i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part except the shops and public places      509.72152100747417
 the country is a vast deal pleasanter is not it mr      498.2491261855391
 bingley      40.11910197869102
 when i am in the country he replied i never wish to leave it and when i am in town it is pretty much the same      301.56392092094086
 they have each their advantages and i can be equally happy in either      471.00027527001606
 ayethat is because you have the right disposition      782.3758623344032
 but that gentleman looking at darcy seemed to think the country was nothing at all      818.558915470475
 you quite mistook mr      40.11910197869102
 he only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town which you must acknowledge to be true      743.763542899203
 certainly my dear nobody said there were but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger      254.65492102422263
 i know we dine with four and twenty families      209.64421743821836
 nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance      267.25063562027174
 his sister was less delicate and directed her eye towards mr      1792.8707847316095
 darcy with a very expressive smile      113.50930596523533
 elizabeth for the sake of saying something that might turn her mothers thoughts now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since her coming away      691.681029976365
 yes she called yesterday with her father      1428.6093873842615
 what an agreeable man sir william is mr      292.3898369722014
 bingleyis not he      631.7212696375212
 so much the man of fashion      621.4382623065666
 so genteel and so easy      222.57801992561048
that is my idea of good breeding and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter      290.45430798052246
 did charlotte dine with you      44.519480662564156
 no she would go home      193.76542062357612
 for my part mr      192.09454952389007
 bingley i always keep servants that can do their own work my daughters are brought up differently      285.6866307967816
 but every body is to judge for themselves and the lucases are very good sort of girls i assure you      625.8471823824011
 it is a pity they are not handsome      346.1822427794401
 not that i think charlotte so very plainbut then she is our particular friend      342.1561919012157
 she seems a very pleasant young woman said bingley      8912.447784181973
 lady lucas herself has often said so and envied me janes beauty      146.85881683205886
 i do not like to boast of my own child but to be sure janeone does not often see any body better looking      318.66235863489015
 it is what every body says      586.6595363047983
 i do not trust my own partiality      43.215159672798116
 when she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my brother gardiners in town so much in love with her that my sisterinlaw was sure he would make her an offer before we came away      1213.3354064943937
 but however he did not      814.6955581649441
 perhaps he thought her too young      596.9773285174169
 however he wrote some verses on her and very pretty they were      522.5652070750895
 and so ended his affection said elizabeth impatiently      128.7995177991197
 there has been many a one i fancy overcome in the same way      1611.2638776831805
 i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love      230.97628785853752
 i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love said darcy      417.0930697981887
 of a fine stout healthy love it may      222.0666533934659
 every thing nourishes what is strong already      380.52835234615804
 but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away      431.2294279747223
 she longed to speak but could think of nothing to say and after a short silence mrs      672.9541071238667
 bennet began repeating her thanks to mr      3269.027341569461
 bingley for his kindness to jane with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy      185.0139203633209
 bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to be civil also and say what the occasion required      1184.6907134469636
 she performed her part indeed without much graciousness but mrs      1876.5920961894194
 bennet was satisfied and soon afterwards ordered her carriage      2730.5335421894088
 upon this signal the youngest of her daughters put herself forward      360.18137358366636
 the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit and the result of it was that the youngest should tax mr      661.616713278182
 bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield      262.21754446282426
 lydia was a stout wellgrown girl of fifteen with a fine complexion and goodhumoured countenance a favourite with her mother whose affection had brought her into public at an early age      317.43358055001926
 she had high animal spirits and a sort of natural selfconsequence which the attentions of the officers to whom her uncles good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her had increased into assurance      249.17481474332186
 she was very equal therefore to address mr      2262.793893118989
 bingley on the subject of the ball and abruptly reminded him of his promise adding that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it      844.1810973121997
 his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mothers ear      652.8284942475765
 lydia declared herself satisfied      40.11910197869102
 yesit would be much better to wait till jane was well and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again      1293.0601671868706
 and when you have given your ball she added i shall insist on their giving one also      106.41270209060737
 i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not      304.0987793137709
 bennet and her daughters then departed and elizabeth returned instantly to jane leaving her own and her relations behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr      506.66143538891174
 chapter x      620.1082954481221
 the day passed much as the day before had done      428.8650975691982
 the loo table however did not appear      344.6535336432692
 hurst and mr      40.11910197869101
 bingley were at piquet and mrs      162.5378466980104
 hurst was observing their game      193.76542062357612
 elizabeth took up some needlework and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion      479.629298334242
 the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his handwriting or on the evenness of his lines or on the length of his letter with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received formed a curious dialogue and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each      842.8814797308235
 how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter      165.30266447272706
 you write uncommonly fast      40.11910197869102
 how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year      857.2719413546547
 letters of business too      1729.4435253892393
 how odious i should think them      132.77524072035618
 it is fortunate then that they fall to my lot instead of to yours      359.14610428810005
 i have already told her so once by your desire      108.21387910200887
 i am afraid you do not like your pen      242.3590892531792
 let me mend it for you      1832.2815889285312
 i mend pens remarkably well      1038.4850141414397
 how can you contrive to write so even      214.75131045445613
 he was silent      553.6385512922801
 tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantleys      396.27534027957086
 will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again      75.5112272020155
at present i have not room to do them justice      4552.063499342088
 it is of no consequence      202.60430451798896
 i shall see her in january      196.7241522629276
 they are generally long but whether always charming it is not for me to determine      556.2639535303587
 that will not do for a compliment to darcy caroline cried her brotherbecause he does not write with ease      270.67625507353944
 he studies too much for words of four syllables      578.5302190388815
do not you darcy      40.11910197869102
 cried miss bingley charles writes in the most careless way imaginable      1353.6630199949905
 he leaves out half his words and blots the rest      1010.1508626199877
 your humility mr      40.11910197869101
 bingley said elizabeth must disarm reproof      162.5378466980104
 nothing is more deceitful said darcy than the appearance of humility      173.3104708652395
 it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an indirect boast      960.566660070621
 and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty      169.88704264777772
 the indirect boastfor you are really proud of your defects in writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think at least highly interesting      394.28517099788166
 the power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance      304.6894318335733
 when you told mrs      1729.4435253892393
 bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of panegyric of compliment to yourselfand yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else      402.89053542739435
 and yet upon my honour i believed what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at this moment      168.46206843781735
 at least therefore i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies      1547.497458209289
 i dare say you believed it but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity      305.4994390263807
 your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know and if as you were mounting your horse a friend were to say bingley you had better stay till next week you would probably do it you would probably not goand at another word might stay a month      411.90998864926996
 you have only proved by this cried elizabeth that mr      95.16968476378769
 you have shewn him off now much more than he did himself      168.27851566083282
 i am exceedingly gratified said bingley by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper      456.4784787094895
 but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend for he would certainly think the better of me if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as i could      181.8351931773434
 would mr      1454.2828608835578
 darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it      400.8416024000834
 upon my word i cannot exactly explain the matter darcy must speak for himself      206.36019223080186
 allowing the case however to stand according to your representation you must remember miss bennet that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety      396.42099758263106
 to yield readilyeasilyto the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you      252.2495520674594
 to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either      276.21263489802595
 you appear to me mr      40.119101978691035
 darcy to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection      141.60692099931495
 a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it      302.5558473987675
 i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr      351.46867103334085
 bingley      40.11910197869102
 but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to be argued into it      584.403402771618
 will it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties      816.4232150381115
 by all means cried bingley let us hear all the particulars not forgetting their comparative height and size for that will have more weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of      488.4432871162494
 i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much deference      325.6544292912057
 i declare i do not know a more aweful object than darcy on particular occasions and in particular places at his own house especially and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do      294.0931785887009
 darcy smiled but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended and therefore checked her laugh      520.4301773330858
 miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense      832.3605377687288
 i see your design bingley said his friend      894.51734670968
you dislike an argument and want to silence this      115.07144630247969
 perhaps i do      7640.1422354822
 arguments are too much like disputes      169.27659545907346
 if you and miss bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room i shall be very thankful and then you may say whatever you like of me      436.11486006579156
 what you ask said elizabeth is no sacrifice on my side and mr      263.26495007287605
 darcy had much better finish his letter      97.83758319273011
 when that business was over he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music      1320.469020400184
 hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument how frequently mr      552.6447537579268
 darcys eyes were fixed on her      113.50930596523533
 she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange      605.7394256960191
 she could only imagine however at last that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible according to his ideas of right than in any other person present      299.3679254313234
 the supposition did not pain her      1832.2815889285312
 she liked him too little to care for his approbation      480.7743110545958
 after playing some italian songs miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air and soon afterwards mr      746.8806220850148
 she smiled but made no answer      2308.530143225881
 he repeated the question with some surprise at her silence      2071.3132129778046
 said she i heard you before but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply      322.85897057819056
 you wanted me i know to say yes that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt      450.1112041789513
 i have therefore made up my mind to tell you that i do not want to dance a reel at alland now despise me if you dare      734.1649431693966
 indeed i do not dare      215.01817017506332
 elizabeth having rather expected to affront him was amazed at his gallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her      684.4988033740224
 he really believed that were it not for the inferiority of her connections he should be in some danger      515.9327210935355
 miss bingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth      1684.5098792983772
 she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest by talking of their supposed marriage and planning his happiness in such an alliance      693.2941969665279
 i hope said she as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day you will give your motherinlaw a few hints when this desirable event takes place as to the advantage of holding her tongue and if you can compass it do cure the younger girls of running after the officers      607.4828920993303
and if i may mention so delicate a subject endeavour to check that little something bordering on conceit and impertinence which your lady possesses      305.5182609937122
 have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity      91.67435702040133
do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley      587.0933485588748
 they are in the same profession you know only in different lines      301.75790502886076
 as for your elizabeths picture you must not attempt to have it taken for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes      449.15787640507534
 it would not be easy indeed to catch their expression but their colour and shape and the eyelashes so remarkably fine might be copied      405.8037050559636
 hurst and elizabeth herself      40.11910197869102
 i did not know that you intended to walk said miss bingley in some confusion lest they had been overheard      184.61295128217694
 you used us abominably ill answered mrs      123.55749986770849
 then taking the disengaged arm of mr      961.3828248384349
 darcy she left elizabeth to walk by herself      234.1879646505818
 the path just admitted three      814.6955581649441
 darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said this walk is not wide enough for our party      589.9204461053218
 we had better go into the avenue      384.4056154820648
 but elizabeth who had not the least inclination to remain with them laughingly answered no no stay where you are      606.6773030791635
you are charmingly groupd and appear to uncommon advantage      192.49956540173207
 the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth      2216.397796997456
 good bye      40.11910197869102
 she then ran gaily off rejoicing as she rambled about in the hope of being at home again in a day or two      297.39225647749373
 jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening      374.2101330237491
 chapter xi      620.1082954481221
 they could describe an entertainment with accuracy relate an anecdote with humour and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit      582.756785981444
 but when the gentlemen entered jane was no longer the first object      897.2998697585803
 miss bingleys eyes were instantly turned towards darcy and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps      2370.054740176856
 he addressed himself directly to miss bennet with a polite congratulation mr      1276.5000782476222
 hurst also made her a slight bow and said he was very glad but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingleys salutation      422.98643587790957
 he was full of joy and attention      1183.8798587590245
 he then sat down by her and talked scarcely to any one else      833.6090343847716
 elizabeth at work in the opposite corner saw it all with great delight      872.4032720364584
 when tea was over mr      814.6955581649441
 hurst reminded his sisterinlaw of the cardtablebut in vain      553.6385512922801
 darcy did not wish for cards and mr      87.52082483823872
 hurst soon found even his open petition rejected      768.6182880412397
 she assured him that no one intended to play and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her      699.1279167859574
 hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep      444.69991819065456
 darcy took up a book miss bingley did the same and mrs      122.76491935212877
 miss bingleys attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr      876.3426681732298
 darcys progress through his book as in reading her own and she was perpetually either making some inquiry or looking at his page      435.94684610537547
 she could not win him however to any conversation he merely answered her question and read on      346.9516422216156
 at length quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his she gave a great yawn and said how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way      1219.5817536167885
 she then yawned again threw aside her book and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet she turned suddenly towards him and said by the bye charles are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield      421.5046609713192
i would advise you before you determine on it to consult the wishes of the present party i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure      426.07359122352176
 i should like balls infinitely better she replied if they were carried on in a different manner but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting      256.9469197314992
 it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day      354.06132832727496
 much more rational my dear caroline i dare say but it would not be near so much like a ball      272.65974387676044
 miss bingley made no answer and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room      1100.1990641122743
 her figure was elegant and she walked wellbut darcy at whom it was all aimed was still inflexibly studious      717.4397899523353
 in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more and turning to elizabeth said miss eliza bennet let me persuade you to follow my example and take a turn about the room      714.1807080308329
i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude      269.93344631945695
 elizabeth was surprised but agreed to it immediately      902.4873677981599
 miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility mr      999.2459753069838
 he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be and unconsciously closed his book      872.5938063520547
 he was directly invited to join their party but he declined it observing that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together with either of which motives his joining them would interfere      388.9490464174023
 what could he mean      270.45643337730826
 she was dying to know what could be his meaningand asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him      340.88884513104375
 not at all was her answer but depend upon it he means to be severe on us and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it      524.9808214172916
 miss bingley however was incapable of disappointing mr      2742.5709876375968
 darcy in any thing and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives      106.93483983618162
 you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each others confidence and have secret affairs to discuss or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walkingif the first i should be completely in your wayand if the second i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire      858.6368929407048
 shocking      40.11910197869102
 cried miss bingley      248.94042605864988
 i never heard any thing so abominable      409.89435694249676
 how shall we punish him for such a speech      251.26965977195474
 we can all plague and punish one another      574.6309223470793
 teaze himlaugh at him      1936.4382685748003
intimate as you are you must know how it is to be done      957.762053452151
 but upon my honour i do not      1061.4526955302235
 i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that      303.1927770483532
 teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind      1537.5957251142509
 no noi feel he may defy us there      42.81544943112701
 darcy may hug himself      48.56388609578208
 darcy is not to be laughed at      97.83758319273011
 cried elizabeth      620.1082954481221
 i dearly love a laugh      215.01817017506332
 miss bingley said he has given me credit for more than can be      999.2459753069838
 the wisest and the best of men nay the wisest and best of their actions may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke      2525.68105940583
 follies and nonsense whims and inconsistencies do divert me i own and i laugh at them whenever i can      336.90872883390824
but these i suppose are precisely what you are without      4217.192448960696
 perhaps that is not possible for any one      2262.793893118989
 but it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule      1166.2707261004718
 such as vanity and pride      665.4705023792866
 yes vanity is a weakness indeed      621.4382623065666
 but pridewhere there is a real superiority of mind pride will be always under good regulation      1191.058797093008
 elizabeth turned away to hide a smile      457.17126674288704
 your examination of mr      40.11910197869102
 darcy is over i presume said miss bingleyand pray what is the result      239.03173718209857
 i am perfectly convinced by it that mr      902.4873677981599
 darcy has no defect      48.56388609578208
 he owns it himself without disguise      493.23587565936685
 i have faults enough but they are not i hope of understanding      154.590315911074
 my temper i dare not vouch for      3269.027341569461
it is i believe too little yieldingcertainly too little for the convenience of the world      1075.1437366395742
 i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought nor their offences against myself      374.51048763413144
 my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them      974.4969238194847
 my temper would perhaps be called resentful      3269.027341569461
my good opinion once lost is lost for ever      96.22979856340096
 that is a failing indeed      826.340678089009
cried elizabeth      620.1082954481221
 but you have chosen your fault well      344.6535336432692
i really cannot laugh at it      184.61315922261164
 you are safe from me      40.119101978691035
 there is i believe in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil a natural defect which not even the best education can overcome      838.2555781367627
 and your defect is a propensity to hate every body      43.30480573363192
 and yours he replied with a smile is wilfully to misunderstand them      87.3091766044505
 do let us have a little musiccried miss bingley tired of a conversation in which she had no share      228.1412393794064
 hurst      40.11910197869102
 he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention      556.9222470831662
 chapter xii      620.1082954481221
 in consequence of an agreement between the sisters elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day      670.7856160192448
 but mrs      2056.6665453882724
 bennet who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday which would exactly finish janes week could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before      365.5060116297143
 her answer therefore was not propitious at least not to elizabeths wishes for she was impatient to get home      1018.6561554715178
 bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday and in her postscript it was added that if mr      1832.2815889285312
 bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer she could spare them very well      128.21848555426467
against staying longer however elizabeth was positively resolvednor did she much expect it would be asked and fearful on the contrary as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long she urged jane to borrow mr      332.58122282710923
 bingleys carriage immediately and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned and the request made      535.2540439415426
 miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other      937.3364096513191
 the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for herthat she was not enough recovered but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right      679.4239111380336
 to mr      1454.2828608835578
 darcy it was welcome intelligenceelizabeth had been at netherfield long enough      273.7061427336308
 she attracted him more than he likedand miss bingley was uncivil to her and more teazing than usual to himself      1272.021918529804
 he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity sensible that if such an idea had been suggested his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it      562.890859717242
 steady to his purpose he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour he adhered most conscientiously to his book and would not even look at her      1165.66843978356
 on sunday after morning service the separation so agreeable to almost all took place      215.5800782257104
 miss bingleys civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly as well as her affection for jane and when they parted after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield and embracing her most tenderly she even shook hands with the former      699.6008355686449
elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits      1424.6450459374068
 they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother      1790.4322196000549
 bennet wondered at their coming and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble and was sure jane would have caught cold again      997.7296367582319
but their father though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure was really glad to see them he had felt their importance in the family circle      543.6600476937967
 the evening conversation when they were all assembled had lost much of its animation and almost all its sense by the absence of jane and elizabeth      430.5856847841497
 they found mary as usual deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature and had some new extracts to admire and some new observations of threadbare morality to listen to      388.30040560894145
 catherine and lydia had information for them of a different sort      596.3839407098689
 much had been done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle a private had been flogged and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married      327.4904302702876
 chapter xiii      620.1082954481221
 i hope my dear said mr      162.5378466980104
 bennet to his wife as they were at breakfast the next morning that you have ordered a good dinner today because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party      1516.111517436491
 who do you mean my dear      132.77524072035618
 i know of nobody that is coming i am sure unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in and i hope my dinners are good enough for her      252.69334064859422
 i do not believe she often sees such at home      86.65830354848481
 the person of whom i speak is a gentleman and a stranger      1067.0753894079187
 bennets eyes sparkled      7640.1422354822
a gentleman and a stranger      225.75951233528167
 it is mr      522.6542288787506
 bingley i am sure      327.15695039771015
 why janeyou never dropt a word of this you sly thing      169.00633687602323
 well i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr      581.6040686906538
 bingley      40.11910197869102
butgood lord      2056.6665453882724
 how unlucky      40.11910197869102
 there is not a bit of fish to be got today      736.8791745000457
 i must speak to hill this moment      1262.3792521726189
 it is not mr      275.1051068147718
 bingley said her husband it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life      240.08810051778894
 this roused a general astonishment and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once      389.1347726049728
 after amusing himself some time with their curiosity he thus explained      1340.150098502613
 about a month ago i received this letter and about a fortnight ago i answered it for i thought it a case of some delicacy and requiring early attention      346.68924511061186
 it is from my cousin mr      586.6595363047983
 collins who when i am dead may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases      284.1452960228485
 my dear cried his wife i cannot bear to hear that mentioned      259.09181294206434
 pray do not talk of that odious man      118.10967858460478
 jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail      156.215447953192
 they had often attempted it before but it was a subject on which mrs      569.4016940567348
 bennet was beyond the reach of reason and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about      914.9970681072441
 it certainly is a most iniquitous affair said mr      971.6510988175258
 bennet and nothing can clear mr      2056.6665453882715
 but if you will listen to his letter you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself      355.40057823414554
 no that i am sure i shall not and i think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all and very hypocritical      280.6531775476148
 i hate such false friends      48.7335340966758
 why could not he keep on quarrelling with you as his father did before him      150.56109466801368
 why indeed he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head as you will hear      354.06132832727496
 hunsford near westerham kent th october      475.22905903646335
 dear sir the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness and since i have had the misfortune to lose him i have frequently wished to heal the breach but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance      798.1524728086816
there mrs      1454.2828608835578
my mind however is now made up on the subject for having received ordination at easter i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh widow of sir lewis de bourgh whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england      455.9954826628329
 i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters and beg leave to apologise for it as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amendsbut of this hereafter      651.165904870878
 if you should have no objection to receive me into your house i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family monday november th by four oclock and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday senight following which i can do without any inconvenience as lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day      452.87248487719546
 i remain dear sir with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters your wellwisher and friend william collins      284.79324158680635
 bennet as he folded up the letter      3269.027341569461
 there is some sense in what he says about the girls however and if he is disposed to make them any amends i shall not be the person to discourage him      1522.9788598168934
 though it is difficult said jane to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due the wish is certainly to his credit      296.9157568304492
 elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady catherine and his kind intention of christening marrying and burying his parishioners whenever it were required      1033.9789617505428
 he must be an oddity i think said she      1327.9590928053851
 i cannot make him out      145.70499561848857
there is something very pompous in his style      2012.7249867523492
and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail      220.11852771819437
we cannot suppose he would help it if he could      691.8962414121942
can he be a sensible man sir      301.3169930576569
 no my dear i think not      149.03516866374105
 i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse      100.25316076713236
 there is a mixture of servility and selfimportance in his letter which promises well      752.9572565171392
 i am impatient to see him      184.61315922261164
 in point of composition said mary his letter does not seem defective      258.5770334494183
 the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new yet i think it is well expressed      503.42893841494976
 to catherine and lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting      482.99760137523776
 it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour      1797.257792312307
 as for their mother mr      907.7852642774074
 collinss letter had done away much of her illwill and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters      403.58774237082594
 collins was punctual to his time and was received with great politeness by the whole family      457.695528458143
 bennet indeed said little but the ladies were ready enough to talk and mr      1157.5646245458843
 collins seemed neither in need of encouragement nor inclined to be silent himself      1462.9490315165806
 he was a tall heavy looking young man of five and twenty      616.3315506379545
 his air was grave and stately and his manners were very formal      355.82088405417966
 he had not been long seated before he complimented mrs      95.16968476378769
 bennet on having so fine a family of daughters said he had heard much of their beauty but that in this instance fame had fallen short of the truth and added that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage      336.97124411389035
 this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers but mrs      212.09011440311772
 bennet who quarrelled with no compliments answered most readily you are very kind sir i am sure and i wish with all my heart it may prove so for else they will be destitute enough      534.0415658724198
 things are settled so oddly      187.18418916480326
 you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate      43.674033696733034
 sir i do indeed      389.0573731355492
 it is a grievous affair to my poor girls you must confess      179.03311668113815
 not that i mean to find fault with you for such things i know are all chance in this world      410.6931179499294
 there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed      339.0920398665241
 i am very sensible madam of the hardship to my fair cousinsand could say much on the subject but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate      746.2470086971028
 but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them      651.3437201756523
 at present i will not say more but perhaps when we are better acquainted he was interrupted by a summons to dinner and the girls smiled on each other      631.3113941057481
 they were not the only objects of mr      1729.4435253892393
 collinss admiration      620.1082954481221
 the hall the diningroom and all its furniture were examined and praised and his commendation of every thing would have touched mrs      171.1448737859036
 bennets heart but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property      1638.3230623333739
 the dinner too in its turn was highly admired and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of its cookery was owing      303.0982691414704
 but here he was set right by mrs      704.8260778148694
 bennet who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen      806.7122978682585
 he begged pardon for having displeased her      1171.9387903957215
 in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour      861.6473034534755
 chapter xiv      620.1082954481221
 during dinner mr      40.11910197869101
 bennet scarcely spoke at all but when the servants were withdrawn he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness      1083.3601781218301
 lady catherine de bourghs attention to his wishes and consideration for his comfort appeared very remarkable      269.12986413765776
 bennet could not have chosen better      2056.6665453882715
 collins was eloquent in her praise      106.75123397241158
 the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of ranksuch affability and condescension as he had himself experienced from lady catherine      757.0844153741784
 she had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her      499.11603872126085
 she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings and had sent for him only the saturday before to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening      641.0879813625096
 she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could provided he chose with discretion and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herselfsome shelves in the closets up stairs      516.6842609199792
 that is all very proper and civil i am sure said mrs      321.5975504462417
 bennet and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman      707.380452269879
 it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her      427.57839237692593
 the garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from rosings park her ladyships residence      260.18173084166796
 i think you said she was a widow sir      100.019063555426
 has she any family      347.71207448182764
 she has one only daughter the heiress of rosings and of very extensive property      443.70548726200417
 bennet shaking her head then she is better off than many girls      1137.2322834168494
 and what sort of young lady is she      114.60547728798599
 lady catherine herself says that in point of true beauty miss de bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth      516.9797496713571
 she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of as i am informed by the lady who superintended her education and who still resides with them      492.3757987918873
 but she is perfectly amiable and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies      2561.101195269369
 has she been presented      347.71207448182764
 i do not remember her name among the ladies at court      80.79878331101224
 her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town and by that means as i told lady catherine myself one day has deprived the british court of its brightest ornament      858.3990240760611
 her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies      1364.3127402112966
 i have more than once observed to lady catherine that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess and that the most elevated rank instead of giving her consequence would be adorned by her      462.5465515714523
these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay      771.1194215654115
 you judge very properly said mr      40.11910197869101
 bennet and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy      478.5906212460877
 may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are the result of previous study      571.3774522750358
 they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible      742.9056804897746
 bennets expectations were fully answered      935.8394474874626
 bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawingroom again and when tea was over glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies      617.4811487004462
 collins readily assented and a book was produced but on beholding it for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library he started back and begging pardon protested that he never read novels      331.8720163107099
kitty stared at him and lydia exclaimed      1035.5743332476811
other books were produced and after some deliberation he chose fordyces sermons      553.6385512922801
 lydia gaped as he opened the volume and before he had with very monotonous solemnity read three pages she interrupted him with do you know mama that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard and if he does colonel forster will hire him      513.8453802712686
 my aunt told me so herself on saturday      289.8076920581833
 i shall walk to meryton tomorrow to hear more about it and to ask when mr      191.12713506816527
 denny comes back from town      193.76542062357612
 lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue but mr      260.50734502961984
 collins much offended laid aside his book and said i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp though written solely for their benefit      350.6069040727069
 but i will no longer importune my young cousin      525.4616033232192
 then turning to mr      1729.4435253892393
 bennet he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon      1229.5237429804772
 bennet accepted the challenge observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements      2776.1869261067754
 bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydias interruption and promised that it should not occur again if he would resume his book but mr      467.18875910683875
 collins after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will and should never resent her behaviour as any affront seated himself at another table with mr      590.7070514317568
 bennet and prepared for backgammon      935.8394474874626
 chapter xv      620.1082954481221
 collins was not a sensible man and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father and though he belonged to one of the universities he had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful acquaintance      560.3846529772215
 having now a good house and very sufficient income he intended to marry and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had a wife in view as he meant to chuse one of the daughters if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report      267.8242106706097
 this was his plan of amendsof atonementfor inheriting their fathers estate and he thought it an excellent one full of eligibility and suitableness and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part      638.7763333603626
 his plan did not vary on seeing them      353.7400499413382
miss bennets lovely face confirmed his views and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority and for the first evening she was his settled choice      1493.4011432860864
 bennet before breakfast a conversation beginning with his parsonagehouse and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes that a mistress for it might be found at longbourn produced from her amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement a caution against the very jane he had fixed on      874.2602794137339
as to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to sayshe could not positively answerbut she did not know of any prepossessionher eldest daughter she must just mentionshe felt it incumbent on her to hint was likely to be very soon engaged      334.9763339235095
 collins had only to change from jane to elizabethand it was soon donedone while mrs      111.46365890499148
 bennet was stirring the fire      935.8394474874626
 elizabeth equally next to jane in birth and beauty succeeded her of course      867.6540528462575
 bennet treasured up the hint and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces      675.2767755298287
 collins was to attend them at the request of mr      352.93845979286675
 bennet who was most anxious to get rid of him and have his library to himself for thither mr      1617.901609296082
 bennet with little cessation of his house and garden at hunsford      2552.979095296374
 bennet exceedingly      2056.6665453882724
 in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity and though prepared as he told elizabeth to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house he was used to be free from them there his civility therefore was most prompt in inviting mr      406.9641670941631
 collins to join his daughters in their walk and mr      352.93845979286675
 collins being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader was extremely well pleased to close his large book and go      467.08529150593984
 in pompous nothings on his side and civil assents on that of his cousins their time passed till they entered meryton      413.2806401266472
 the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him      847.454204012905
 their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed or a really new muslin in a shop window could recal them      1206.246606688771
 but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man whom they had never seen before of most gentlemanlike appearance walking with an officer on the other side of the way      579.1143664826826
 the officer was the very mr      493.23587565936685
 denny concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire and he bowed as they passed      219.8913318682425
 all were struck with the strangers air all wondered who he could be and kitty and lydia determined if possible to find out led the way across the street under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot      488.4467736071707
 denny addressed them directly and entreated permission to introduce his friend mr      158.83376830846416
 wickham who had returned with him the day before from town and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps      360.4062660057682
 this was exactly as it should be for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming      1010.6253004479186
 the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversationa readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably when the sound of horses drew their notice and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street      363.29321406204133
 on distinguishing the ladies of the group the two gentlemen came directly towards them and began the usual civilities      160.95834898376404
 bingley was the principal spokesman and miss bennet the principal object      352.37771914709464
 he was then he said on his way to longbourn on purpose to inquire after her      772.034833962984
 both changed colour one looked white the other red      412.94219092552316
 wickham after a few moments touched his hata salutation which mr      552.269800809753
 darcy just deigned to return      139.75505364770575
 what could be the meaning of it      761.2599170904274
it was impossible to imagine it was impossible not to long to know      3198.770996743142
 in another minute mr      45.693014538637115
 bingley but without seeming to have noticed what passed took leave and rode on with his friend      607.7744527274045
 denny and mr      553.6385512922801
 wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of mr      583.462744539963
 philipss house and then made their bows in spite of miss lydias pressing entreaties that they would come in and even in spite of mrs      566.3269505353063
 philips was always glad to see her nieces and the two eldest from their recent absence were particularly welcome and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home which as their own carriage had not fetched them she should have known nothing about if she had not happened to see mr      773.2170694844334
 joness shop boy in the street who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield because the miss bennets were come away when her civility was claimed towards mr      949.8572268929662
 collins by janes introduction of him      106.75123397241158
 she received him with her very best politeness which he returned with as much more apologising for his intrusion without any previous acquaintance with her which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice      1348.1721324797938
 philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other of whom however she could only tell her nieces what they already knew that mr      1060.088709137884
 denny had brought him from london and that he was to have a lieutenants commission in the shire      149.62388448186877
 she had been watching him the last hour she said as he walked up and down the street and had mr      766.490956151635
 wickham appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers who in comparison with the stranger were become stupid disagreeable fellows      359.57938160455376
 some of them were to dine with the philipses the next day and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr      1521.4499854746343
 wickham and give him an invitation also if the family from longbourn would come in the evening      248.10271913812835
 philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets and a little bit of hot supper afterwards      1491.1279496179986
 the prospect of such delights was very cheering and they parted in mutual good spirits      2175.988272225721
 collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless      688.2769302617014
 as they walked home elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen but though jane would have defended either or both had they appeared to be wrong she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister      680.7096853045069
 collins on his return highly gratified mrs      94.48952093091286
 bennet by admiring mrs      2056.6665453882724
 philipss manners and politeness      317.1260553314424
 he protested that except lady catherine and her daughter he had never seen a more elegant woman for she had not only received him with the utmost civility but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening although utterly unknown to her before      1011.7453527113256
 something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life      1246.8047839752523
 chapter xvi      620.1082954481221
 as no objection was made to the young peoples engagement with their aunt and all mr      438.29073961258507
 collinss scruples of leaving mr      119.94930567577303
 bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton and the girls had the pleasure of hearing as they entered the drawingroom that mr      286.97391898457244
 wickham had accepted their uncles invitation and was then in the house      263.3479902543131
 when this information was given and they had all taken their seats mr      464.6819920742352
 collins was at leisure to look around him and admire and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification but when mrs      246.29181542416492
 philips understood from him what rosings was and who was its proprietor when she had listened to the description of only one of lady catherines drawingrooms and found that the chimneypiece alone had cost eight hundred pounds she felt all the force of the compliment and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeepers room      458.16471993024965
 philips a very attentive listener whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could      908.2931491053768
 to the girls who could not listen to their cousin and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantlepiece the interval of waiting appeared very long      377.4635034287534
 it was over at last however      516.7497138521829
 the gentlemen did approach and when mr      1061.4526955302235
 the officers of the shire were in general a very creditable gentlemanlike set and the best of them were of the present party but mr      1001.2298954492301
 wickham was as far beyond them all in person countenance air and walk as they were superior to the broadfaced stuffy uncle philips breathing port wine who followed them into the room      742.0969257044861
 wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation though it was only on its being a wet night and on the probability of a rainy season made her feel that the commonest dullest most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker      965.5106460626624
 with such rivals for the notice of the fair as mr      556.3625093452954
 wickham and the officers mr      559.6489556452747
 philips and was by her watchfulness most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin      299.18986954309423
 when the card tables were placed he had an opportunity of obliging her in return by sitting down to whist      807.536396291317
 i know little of the game at present said he but i shall be glad to improve myself for in my situation of life mrs      449.63616014659533
 philips was very thankful for his compliance but could not wait for his reason      798.2455941264249
 at first there seemed danger of lydias engrossing him entirely for she was a most determined talker but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets she soon grew too much interested in the game too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for any one in particular      672.1816077434695
 allowing for the common demands of the game mr      102.76480283139172
 wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth and she was very willing to hear him though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told the history of his acquaintance with mr      1008.788485793041
 her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved      371.2452246712325
 wickham began the subject himself      559.6489556452747
 about a month said elizabeth and then unwilling to let the subject drop added he is a man of very large property in derbyshire i understand      380.9599832961263
 yes replied wickhamhis estate there is a noble one      1434.2751510350479
 a clear ten thousand per annum      421.6664313278577
 you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myselffor i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy      370.89100211975034
 elizabeth could not but look surprised      175.26129507828713
 you may well be surprised miss bennet at such an assertion after seeing as you probably might the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday      739.2158440793285
are you much acquainted with mr      169.27659545907346
 as much as i ever wish to be cried elizabeth warmlyi have spent four days in the same house with him and i think him very disagreeable      571.6460573291338
 i have no right to give my opinion said wickham as to his being agreeable or otherwise      108.15846795457621
 i am not qualified to form one      148.44344286524932
 i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge      128.8881299894512
 it is impossible for me to be impartial      343.7505029352178
 but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonishand perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else      499.2011587299522
here you are in your own family      380.52835234615804
 upon my word i say no more here than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood except netherfield      206.61813764297517
 he is not at all liked in hertfordshire      334.29939977041204
 every body is disgusted with his pride      380.52835234615804
 you will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one      76.21966218932734
 i cannot pretend to be sorry said wickham after a short interruption that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts but with him i believe it does not often happen      469.47495744503794
 the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence or frightened by his high and imposing manners and sees him only as he chuses to be seen      317.5984582399055
 wickham only shook his head      559.6489556452747
 i wonder said he at the next opportunity of speaking whether he is likely to be in this country much longer      285.9834451822182
 i do not at all know but i heard nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield      95.15909607870043
 i hope your plans in favour of the shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood      233.60180378969633
 noit is not for me to be driven away by mr      184.58277270166755
 we are not on friendly terms and it always gives me pain to meet him but i have no reason for avoiding him but what i might proclaim to all the world a sense of very great ill usage and most painful regrets at his being what he is      455.4139111238543
 his father miss bennet the late mr      383.60031107455757
 darcy was one of the best men that ever breathed and the truest friend i ever had and i can never be in company with this mr      882.0763344999898
 darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections      233.23305408703388
 elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase and listened with all her heart but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry      462.85624816252846
 it was the prospect of constant society and good society he added which was my chief inducement to enter the shire      2202.3576777443686
 i knew it to be a most respectable agreeable corps and my friend denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them      1567.3001665681222
 society i own is necessary to me      2760.179799728864
 i must have employment and society      603.7985448863138
 a military life is not what i was intended for but circumstances have now made it eligible      267.9586769242141
 the church ought to have been my professioni was brought up for the church and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now      633.7030573357201
 yesthe late mr      553.6385512922801
 darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift      413.11425856491593
 he was my godfather and excessively attached to me      1445.6288228452945
 i cannot do justice to his kindness      105.387871890059
 he meant to provide for me amply and thought he had done it but when the living fell it was given elsewhere      650.2346716411956
 good heavens      40.11910197869102
 cried elizabeth but how could that be      291.00574026113895
how could his will be disregarded      330.7418947753233
why did not you seek legal redress      120.54515107650349
 there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law      1278.5138207441692
 a man of honour could not have doubted the intention but mr      148.02988966070035
 certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago exactly as i was of an age to hold it and that it was given to another man and no less certain is it that i cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it      675.2173095852935
 i have a warm unguarded temper and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him and to him too freely      133.84101183367832
 i can recal nothing worse      145.70499561848857
 but the fact is that we are very different sort of men and that he hates me      1281.183722155735
 this is quite shocking      266.67016311176104
he deserves to be publicly disgraced      2056.6665453882715
 some time or other he will bebut it shall not be by me      1581.3354915603159
 till i can forget his father i can never defy or expose him      197.58798136367759
 but what said she after a pause can have been his motive      1052.066691892618
what can have induced him to behave so cruelly      430.88827224069234
 a thorough determined dislike of mea dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy      246.64605073949383
 had the late mr      48.56388609578208
 darcy liked me less his son might have borne with me better but his fathers uncommon attachment to me irritated him i believe very early in life      600.1838281492949
 he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stoodthe sort of preference which was often given me      605.8676395360733
 i had not thought mr      48.7335340966758
 darcy so bad as thisthough i have never liked him i had not thought so very ill of himi had supposed him to be despising his fellowcreatures in general but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge such injustice such inhumanity as this      280.9234906105327
 after a few minutes reflection however she continued i do remember his boasting one day at netherfield of the implacability of his resentments of his having an unforgiving temper      1859.3926829373834
 his disposition must be dreadful      246.99101837456777
 i will not trust myself on the subject replied wickham i can hardly be just to him      382.4617500634491
 elizabeth was again deep in thought and after a time exclaimed to treat in such a manner the godson the friend the favourite of his father      698.1157943423746
she could have added a young man too like you whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiablebut she contented herself with and one too who had probably been his own companion from childhood connected together as i think you said in the closest manner      161.88217680558444
 we were born in the same parish within the same park the greatest part of our youth was passed together inmates of the same house sharing the same amusements objects of the same parental care      979.0114116736554
 my father began life in the profession which your uncle mr      611.0972462603074
 he was most highly esteemed by mr      1183.8798587590245
 darcy a most intimate confidential friend      113.50930596523533
 darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my fathers active superintendance and when immediately before my fathers death mr      335.6145402027428
 darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him as of affection to myself      178.28864728528598
 how strange      40.11910197869102
 cried elizabeth      620.1082954481221
 how abominable      40.11910197869102
i wonder that the very pride of this mr      226.428278746604
 darcy has not made him just to you      87.52082483823872
if from no better motive that he should not have been too proud to be dishonestfor dishonesty i must call it      1358.1039579584103
 it is wonderfulreplied wickhamfor almost all his actions may be traced to prideand pride has often been his best friend      592.6789771185536
 it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling      310.4683051045761
 but we are none of us consistent and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride      564.6261986009481
 can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good      264.2531523925646
 it has often led him to be liberal and generousto give his money freely to display hospitality to assist his tenants and relieve the poor      475.2735329636972
 family pride and filial pride for he is very proud of what his father was have done this      243.4551002134442
 he has also brotherly pride which with some brotherly affection makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers      415.4458836522844
 what sort of a girl is miss darcy      775.4665665986237
 he shook his head      287.24835050978845
i wish i could call her amiable      441.5265848586887
 it gives me pain to speak ill of a darcy      472.53904335506195
 but she is too much like her brothervery very proud      973.6236180442825
as a child she was affectionate and pleasing and extremely fond of me and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement      849.420528278357
 she is a handsome girl about fifteen or sixteen and i understand highly accomplished      277.1288876068506
 since her fathers death her home has been london where a lady lives with her and superintends her education      992.6571708707086
 after many pauses and many trials of other subjects elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first and saying i am astonished at his intimacy with mr      654.1017006481669
 bingley      40.11910197869102
 how can mr      40.11910197869101
 bingley who seems good humour itself and is i really believe truly amiable be in friendship with such a man      994.3804309358077
 how can they suit each other      330.7418947753233
do you know mr      40.11910197869102
 bingley      40.11910197869102
 not at all      40.11910197869101
 he is a sweet tempered amiable charming man      353.7400499413382
 he cannot know what mr      579.3257207032427
 darcy is      40.11910197869102
 darcy can please where he chuses      113.50930596523533
 he does not want abilities      193.76542062357612
 he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while      423.1459333944297
 among those who are at all his equals in consequence he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous      414.130498193962
 his pride never deserts him but with the rich he is liberalminded just sincere rational honourable and perhaps agreeableallowing something for fortune and figure      1147.019732810222
 the whist party soon afterwards breaking up the players gathered round the other table and mr      1196.353111760092
 collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mrs      352.93845979286675
 philips      40.11910197869102
 it had not been very great he had lost every point but when mrs      377.77106351669687
 philips began to express her concern thereupon he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance that he considered the money as a mere trifle and begged she would not make herself uneasy      1137.9825976338575
 i know very well madam said he that when persons sit down to a card table they must take their chance of these thingsand happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object      405.86471424717615
 wickhams attention was caught and after observing mr      613.2510446116415
 collins for a few moments he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh      765.421353449169
 lady catherine de bourgh she replied has very lately given him a living      225.68817259455523
 i hardly know how mr      48.7335340966758
 collins was first introduced to her notice but he certainly has not known her long      496.50108533706435
 you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters consequently that she is aunt to the present mr      328.82742120917436
 no indeed i did not      43.424088276614754
 i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday      360.18137358366636
 her daughter miss de bourgh will have a very large fortune and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates      539.4935445463848
 this information made elizabeth smile as she thought of poor miss bingley      528.0129348916532
 vain indeed must be all her attentions vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself if he were already selfdestined to another      454.8783444294473
 collins said she speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship i suspect his gratitude misleads him and that in spite of her being his patroness she is an arrogant conceited woman      364.60594106703604
 i believe her to be both in a great degree replied wickham i have not seen her for many years but i very well remember that i never liked her and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent      495.1933092604611
 elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr      333.8560789038508
 wickhams attentions      1454.2828608835578
 there could be no conversation in the noise of mrs      687.0037055123042
 philipss supper party but his manners recommended him to every body      1792.8707847316095
 whatever he said was said well and whatever he did done gracefully      1013.1587835238822
 elizabeth went away with her head full of him      1418.141328129121
 she could think of nothing but of mr      621.1055034158809
 wickham and of what he had told her all the way home but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went for neither lydia nor mr      259.8878044773169
 collins were once silent      157.7282090905602
 lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won and mr      429.4904503435457
 collins in describing the civility of mr      94.48952093091286
 philips protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist enumerating all the dishes at supper and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house      498.04738132793983
 elizabeth related to jane the next day what had passed between mr      581.6040686906538
 wickham and herself      501.39750398664387
 darcy could be so unworthy of mr      97.83758319273011
 bingleys regard and yet it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham      312.8441614950873
the possibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough to interest all her tender feelings and nothing therefore remained to be done but to think well of them both to defend the conduct of each and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained      344.050970058264
 it is in short impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them without actual blame on either side      907.5670492465343
 very true indeedand now my dear jane what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business      307.810257147594
do clear them too or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody      565.538446518105
 laugh as much as you chuse but you will not laugh me out of my opinion      178.65440242097688
 my dearest lizzy do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places mr      725.4840415835538
 darcy to be treating his fathers favourite in such a mannerone whom his father had promised to provide for      638.0440866711017
it is impossible      522.6542288787506
 no man of common humanity no man who had any value for his character could be capable of it      268.60884539725515
 can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him      330.66150190515646
 no      40.11910197869102
 i can much more easily believe mr      105.387871890059
 wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night names facts every thing mentioned without ceremony      254.26301841344662
if it be not so let mr      978.6279696588989
 darcy contradict it      46.64598115839911
 besides there was truth in his looks      4292.517178550409
 it is difficult indeedit is distressing      586.6595363047983
one does not know what to think      380.52835234615804
 i beg your pardonone knows exactly what to think      244.55606762089144
 but jane could think with certainty on only one pointthat mr      568.8280341973208
 bingley if he had been imposed on would have much to suffer when the affair became public      254.09313525842896
 the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking mr      603.959268245624
 bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield which was fixed for the following tuesday      646.232057996143
 the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again called it an age since they had met and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation      933.3252166999729
 to the rest of the family they paid little attention avoiding mrs      1832.2815889285312
 bennet as much as possible saying not much to elizabeth and nothing at all to the others      957.7378796626782
 they were soon gone again rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs      301.49575085213627
 bennets civilities      2056.6665453882724
 the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family      2175.988272225721
 bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from mr      1021.9150557152605
 wickham and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in mr      312.4776721854715
 darcys looks and behaviour      48.56388609578208
 the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia depended less on any single event or any particular person for though they each like elizabeth meant to dance half the evening with mr      1332.8636083801268
 wickham he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them and a ball was at any rate a ball      468.6354767624169
 and even mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it      241.84385342026107
 while i can have my mornings to myself said she it is enough      223.62865292584144
i think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements      170.60956954469887
 society has claims on us all and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body      660.411740951424
 elizabeths spirits were so high on the occasion that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr      1511.076620854971
 collins she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr      435.6452532843147
 bingleys invitation and if he did whether he would think it proper to join in the evenings amusement and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop or lady catherine de bourgh by venturing to dance      297.5589154603621
 i am by no means of opinion i assure you said he that a ball of this kind given by a young man of character to respectable people can have any evil tendency and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours miss elizabeth for the two first dances especiallya preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause and not to any disrespect for her      258.4928685115808
 elizabeth felt herself completely taken in      175.26129507828713
 she had fully proposed being engaged by wickham for those very dancesand to have mr      191.80953941277784
 collins instead      620.1082954481221
 her liveliness had been never worse timed      130.74524453449624
 there was no help for it however      1061.4526955302235
 wickhams happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer and mr      1143.060413916046
 collinss proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could      672.135674802422
 she was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more      1030.9678249512874
it now first struck her that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of hunsford parsonage and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings in the absence of more eligible visitors      1154.7882620945254
 the idea soon reached to conviction as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her      547.5426949469415
 elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply      448.75585695763857
 collins might never make the offer and till he did it was useless to quarrel about him      375.36394526014544
 if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of the younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time for from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once      659.4548294274197
 no aunt no officers no news could be sought afterthe very shoeroses for netherfield were got by proxy      270.3933846882386
 even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr      716.3313545524171
 wickham and nothing less than a dance on tuesday could have made such a friday saturday sunday and monday endurable to kitty and lydia      273.0657896497152
 till elizabeth entered the drawingroom at netherfield and looked in vain for mr      492.81359734548425
 the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her      1356.5303106790577
 she had dressed with more than usual care and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening      509.8619418681622
 but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr      352.7268215128986
 denny to whom lydia eagerly applied and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before and was not yet returned adding with a significant smile i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here      309.50031873549915
 this part of his intelligence though unheard by lydia was caught by elizabeth and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickhams absence than if her first surmise had been just every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make      362.8508268061608
attention forbearance patience with darcy was injury to wickham      1215.6931203739541
 she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him and turned away with a degree of ill humour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr      502.44340198685325
 but elizabeth was not formed for illhumour and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening it could not dwell long on her spirits and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas whom she had not seen for a week she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin and to point him out to her particular notice      480.6562549506262
 the two first dances however brought a return of distress they were dances of mortification      1280.674221188606
 collins awkward and solemn apologising instead of attending and often moving wrong without being aware of it gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give      253.81641889835618
 the moment of her release from him was ecstacy      2949.1393446137768
 she danced next with an officer and had the refreshment of talking of wickham and of hearing that he was universally liked      853.6024294049288
 when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas and was in conversation with her when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr      1344.5354378694058
 he walked away again immediately and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind charlotte tried to console her      239.14173743605434
 i dare say you will find him very agreeable      266.22604722529286
 heaven forbid      40.11910197869102
that would be the greatest misfortune of all      652.0870560018885
to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate      313.1700648003651
do not wish me such an evil      111.90895152746809
 when the dancing recommenced however and darcy approached to claim her hand charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence      460.33924332905343
 elizabeth made no answer and took her place in the set amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr      558.783590570252
 darcy and reading in her neighbours looks their equal amazement in beholding it      126.00679405675851
 they stood for some time without speaking a word and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances and at first was resolved not to break it till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk she made some slight observation on the dance      663.3112290212903
 he replied and was again silent      553.6385512922801
 after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with it is your turn to say something now mr      1422.7183923116074
i talked about the dance and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room or the number of couples      466.3518015491954
 he smiled and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said      373.68831868664216
 very well      40.11910197869102
that reply will do for the present      1072.26800372346
perhaps by and bye i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones      883.0925126763058
but now we may be silent      493.23587565936685
 do you talk by rule then while you are dancing      86.0695730335846
 sometimes      40.11910197869102
 one must speak a little you know      380.52835234615804
 it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of some conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible      298.13039285122676
 are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine      198.52827388924152
 both replied elizabeth archly for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds      564.4336889099611
we are each of an unsocial taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb      383.6716037847914
 this is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am sure said he      367.66522659954285
 how near it may be to mine i cannot pretend to say      284.8215352053837
you think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly      118.41906196486444
 i must not decide on my own performance      820.2760236494913
 he made no answer and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton      618.2211832990275
 she answered in the affirmative and unable to resist the temptation added when you met us there the other day we had just been forming a new acquaintance      878.4334652570624
 the effect was immediate      1729.4435253892393
 a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features but he said not a word and elizabeth though blaming herself for her own weakness could not go on      567.8199501016323
 at length darcy spoke and in a constrained manner said mr      324.6471975846682
 wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friendswhether he may be equally capable of retaining them is less certain      1476.9455130290664
 he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship replied elizabeth with emphasis and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life      513.4871009231975
 darcy made no answer and seemed desirous of changing the subject      317.42447182688363
 darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner      741.119938365965
 i have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sir      484.1981726112455
 such very superior dancing is not often seen      621.1055034158809
 it is evident that you belong to the first circles      491.6176319493126
 allow me to say however that your fair partner does not disgrace you and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated especially when a certain desirable event my dear miss eliza glancing at her sister and bingley shall take place      360.7863667904244
 what congratulations will then flow in      499.1041075342648
 i appeal to mr      51.161949297677936
 darcybut let me not interrupt you sir      301.3169930576569
you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me      281.85559524555396
 the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy but sir williams allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane who were dancing together      1040.96474004064
 recovering himself however shortly he turned to his partner and said sir williams interruption has made me forget what we were talking of      545.4687289013862
 i do not think we were speaking at all      94.40006465262863
 sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves      209.70619200786706
we have tried two or three subjects already without success and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine      515.764261516367
 what think you of books      826.340678089009
 said he smiling      811.0220925248268
 booksoh      40.11910197869102
 no      40.11910197869102
 i am sorry you think so but if that be the case there can at least be no want of subject      134.64639195630596
 noi cannot talk of books in a ballroom my head is always full of something else      157.55091595190243
 the present always occupies you in such scenesdoes it      2949.1393446137768
 said he with a look of doubt      163.89484864115948
 yes always she replied without knowing what she said for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming i remember hearing you once say mr      743.9399839353371
 darcy that you hardly ever forgave that your resentment once created was unappeasable      207.5533558803815
 you are very cautious i suppose as to its being created      179.99869314869713
 i am said he with a firm voice      389.1932926870036
 and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice      251.26965977195474
 i hope not      47.71804916323267
 it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion to be secure of judging properly at first      318.57638847007115
 may i ask to what these questions tend      133.3777624824681
 merely to the illustration of your character said she endeavouring to shake off her gravity      853.2258699542157
 i am trying to make it out      414.07083491053953
 and what is your success      46.74347398462845
 i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly      330.66150190515646
 i can readily believe answered he gravely that report may vary greatly with respect to me and i could wish miss bennet that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either      393.13861013123227
 but if i do not take your likeness now i may never have another opportunity      178.13210481832093
 she said no more and they went down the other dance and parted in silence on each side dissatisfied though not to an equal degree for in darcys breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her which soon procured her pardon and directed all his anger against another      444.39211201643786
 they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her so miss eliza i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham      438.93785043859486
your sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a thousand questions and i find that the young man forgot to tell you among his other communications that he was the son of old wickham the late mr      629.4941626332678
 darcys steward      40.11910197869102
 let me recommend you however as a friend not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions for as to mr      1011.5329630578725
 darcys using him ill it is perfectly false for on the contrary he has been always remarkably kind to him though george wickham has treated mr      193.4813968251084
 darcy in a most infamous manner      113.50930596523533
 i do not know the particulars but i know very well that mr      72.54831690878414
 darcy is not in the least to blame that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way      517.9303776967321
 his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it      371.48401950075123
 i pity you miss eliza for this discovery of your favourites guilt but really considering his descent one could not expect much better      364.96165557162925
 his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same said elizabeth angrily for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr      590.8865737145255
 darcys steward and of that i can assure you he informed me himself      1387.287247862673
 i beg your pardon replied miss bingley turning away with a sneer      155.64014712431774
 excuse my interference      5297.3787566140445
it was kindly meant      1656.3323860274322
 insolent girl      48.8989988170858
 said elizabeth to herself      456.51142706873367
you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this      605.1091532801244
 i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr      351.06205466839424
 she then sought her eldest sister who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of bingley      553.6385512922801
 jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency a glow of such happy expression as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening      709.6361408106843
elizabeth instantly read her feelings and at that moment solicitude for wickham resentment against his enemies and every thing else gave way before the hope of janes being in the fairest way for happiness      660.1499570668714
 i want to know said she with a countenance no less smiling than her sisters what you have learnt about mr      267.71417708308235
 bingley does not know the whole of his history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr      268.10774341052274
 darcy but he will vouch for the good conduct the probity and honour of his friend and is perfectly convinced that mr      214.38426499241584
 wickham has deserved much less attention from mr      613.2510446116415
 darcy than he has received and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sisters mr      260.23432382727907
 wickham is by no means a respectable young man      452.9506026625008
 i am afraid he has been very imprudent and has deserved to lose mr      139.745580937068
 darcys regard      40.11910197869102
 no he never saw him till the other morning at meryton      343.539201351096
 this account then is what he has received from mr      658.7295487682333
 i am perfectly satisfied      51.161949297677936
 but what does he say of the living      683.9145616261229
 he does not exactly recollect the circumstances though he has heard them from mr      667.799323868955
 i have not a doubt of mr      148.44344286524932
 bingleys sincerity said elizabeth warmly but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only      770.0195012634858
 she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each and on which there could be no difference of sentiment      721.0129517572018
 elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingleys regard and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it      892.4577686613806
 on their being joined by mr      132.77524072035618
 bingley himself elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied before mr      659.7662870215436
 collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery      790.9744711524523
 i have found out said he by a singular accident that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness      164.50790592557908
 i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh and of her mother lady catherine      553.1212349125165
 how wonderfully these sort of things occur      312.16086139288547
 who would have thought of my meeting withperhapsa nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly      236.79172383827026
i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him which i am now going to do and trust he will excuse my not having done it before      592.2691501690771
 my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology      400.1452849507138
 you are not going to introduce yourself to mr      104.7566684648142
 indeed i am      47.71804916323267
 i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier      103.00316723286511
 it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday senight      410.76122919827435
 elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme assuring him that mr      681.9712054068017
 darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side and that if it were it must belong to mr      327.7299023568629
 darcy the superior in consequence to begin the acquaintance      178.23047973175713
 collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination and when she ceased speaking replied thus my dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those which regulate the clergy for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdomprovided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained      486.28509084433944
 you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty      736.2587019053665
 pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice which on every other subject shall be my constant guide though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself      317.5613686206235
 and with a low bow he left her to attack mr      173.35450299575712
 darcy whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident      1303.6935243612415
 her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it she felt as if hearing it all and saw in the motion of his lips the words apology hunsford and lady catherine de bourgh      979.7497160090746
it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man      959.8028503957923
 darcys contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow and moved another way      1604.2452888844466
 collins then returned to elizabeth      119.94930567577303
 darcy seemed much pleased with the attention      97.83758319273011
 he answered me with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of lady catherines discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily      1222.805963315495
 it was really a very handsome thought      1155.0167054475457
 upon the whole i am much pleased with him      512.5999343888922
 as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr      251.1068191084731
 she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow and she felt capable under such circumstances of endeavouring even to like bingleys two sisters      682.0242941409921
 her mothers thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way and she determined not to venture near her lest she might hear too much      935.8394474874624
 when they sat down to supper therefore she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freely openly and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to mr      968.9609347490918
 bingley      40.11910197869102
it was an animating subject and mrs      1275.2418326027098
 bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match      7640.142235482199
 his being such a charming young man and so rich and living but three miles from them were the first points of selfgratulation and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do      167.54973440577874
 it was moreover such a promising thing for her younger daughters as janes marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men and lastly it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked      353.29849885822256
 it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure because on such occasions it is the etiquette but no one was less likely than mrs      1314.3396335826783
 bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life      982.0117284920666
 she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it      421.3009495059248
 in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mothers words or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr      250.52415226438305
 darcy who sat opposite to them      113.50930596523533
 her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical      704.8260778148694
 what is mr      439.4232093657577
 darcy to me pray that i should be afraid of him      278.03915455894736
 i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear      651.2950148961255
 for heavens sake madam speak lower      113.97084354691796
what advantage can it be to you to offend mr      212.14116552572654
you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing      165.30266447272706
 her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone      522.5652070750895
 elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation      1418.141328129121
 she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr      359.0893646518997
 darcy though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded for though he was not always looking at her mother she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her      193.39431209071967
 the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity      2071.4899563443455
 bennet had no more to say and lady lucas who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken      246.477969388642
 elizabeth now began to revive      215.01817017506332
 but not long was the interval of tranquillity for when supper was over singing was talked of and she had the mortification of seeing mary after very little entreaty preparing to oblige the company      379.59243853581694
 by many significant looks and silent entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisancebut in vain mary would not understand them such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her and she began her song      327.61435572323296
 marys powers were by no means fitted for such a display her voice was weak and her manner affected      1740.361530550279
elizabeth was in agonies      327.15695039771015
 she looked at jane to see how she bore it but jane was very composedly talking to bingley      251.26965977195474
 she looked at his two sisters and saw them making signs of derision at each other and at darcy who continued however impenetrably grave      567.4490585203127
 she looked at her father to entreat his interference lest mary should be singing all night      301.2992846901565
 you have delighted us long enough      40.11910197869101
 let the other young ladies have time to exhibit      1138.3849417824417
others of the party were now applied to      768.6182880412397
 if i said mr      218.78303878412083
 collins were so fortunate as to be able to sing i should have great pleasure i am sure in obliging the company with an air for i consider music as a very innocent diversion and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman      849.6285579093352
i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music for there are certainly other things to be attended to      669.9542001092024
 the rector of a parish has much to do      2091.8821662088335
in the first place he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron      945.794931768422
 he must write his own sermons and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties and the care and improvement of his dwelling which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible      853.0439621186167
 and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment      115.45026404593806
 i cannot acquit him of that duty nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family      257.7765356771341
 and with a bow to mr      150.80830190564933
 darcy he concluded his speech which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room      227.13701935296135
 bennet himself while his wife seriously commended mr      1885.9715376448294
 collins for having spoken so sensibly and observed in a halfwhisper to lady lucas that he was a remarkably clever good kind of young man      256.97015886088946
 to elizabeth it appeared that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed      1053.1156536645135
 that his two sisters and mr      499.1041075342648
 darcy however should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman or the insolent smiles of the ladies were more intolerable      219.4971175638741
 the rest of the evening brought her little amusement      2949.1393446137768
 she was teazed by mr      1074.9972338701825
 collins who continued most perseveringly by her side and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again put it out of her power to dance with others      568.1325472436816
 in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room      317.4081012139976
 he assured her that as to dancing he was perfectly indifferent to it that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening      480.7267079435305
 there was no arguing upon such a project      1729.4435253892393
 she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas who often joined them and goodnaturedly engaged mr      567.7234436775722
 she was at least free from the offence of mr      1132.7345502067403
 she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr      1324.6493827264776
 wickham and rejoiced in it      559.6489556452747
 the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart and by a manoeuvre of mrs      231.7288531492414
 bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family      428.18474159958544
 hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves      676.2829377780739
 they repulsed every attempt of mrs      493.23587565936685
 collins who was complimenting mr      119.94930567577303
 bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests      517.832158292077
 darcy said nothing at all      139.75505364770575
 bennet in equal silence was enjoying the scene      1885.9715376448294
 elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mrs      1418.141328129121
 accompanied by a violent yawn      417.84389038983323
 when at length they arose to take leave mrs      516.6576574978824
 bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn and addressed herself particularly to mr      4356.351938806894
 bingley to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time without the ceremony of a formal invitation      442.18556509331813
 bingley was all grateful pleasure and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her after his return from london whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time      475.8015734062006
 bennet was perfectly satisfied and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements new carriages and wedding clothes she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield in the course of three or four months      1555.9967770313947
 of having another daughter married to mr      109.50230017631158
 collins she thought with equal certainty and with considerable though not equal pleasure      435.6452532843147
 elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her the worth of each was eclipsed by mr      1030.1391301186243
 the next day opened a new scene at longbourn      2416.7628870255626
 collins made his declaration in form      106.75123397241158
 having resolved to do it without loss of time as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment he set about it in a very orderly manner with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business      421.75543374560885
 on finding mrs      40.11910197869101
 bennet elizabeth and one of the younger girls together soon after breakfast he addressed the mother in these words may i hope madam for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning      436.76648694792857
 before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise mrs      789.4340293779593
 bennet instantly answered oh dear      935.8394474874626
yescertainly      40.11910197869102
i am sure lizzy will be very happyi am sure she can have no objection      228.87628392562786
come kitty i want you up stairs      880.4229108363995
 and gathering her work together she was hastening away when elizabeth called out dear maam do not go      160.69124756493682
i beg you will not go      603.7985448863138
 collins must excuse me      157.7282090905602
he can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear      203.77451223483303
 i am going away myself      250.52146603727175
 no no nonsense lizzy      40.11910197869102
i desire you will stay where you are      954.6365779487423
 elizabeth would not oppose such an injunctionand a moments consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible she sat down again and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion      347.23220467541836
 collins began      620.1082954481221
 you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mothers permission for this address      524.2814327389805
 you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken      212.31502712721698
 almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life      606.9615010703475
 the idea of mr      1729.4435253892393
 collins with all his solemn composure being run away with by his feelings made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther and he continued my reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish      505.0954959405187
 secondly that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness and thirdlywhich perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness      268.3222441428977
 twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked too      1220.1155810554142
 on this subject and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsfordbetween our pools at quadrille while mrs      525.0493975702828
 jenkinson was arranging miss de bourghs footstool that she said mr      187.50488226368932
 collins you must marry      157.7282090905602
 a clergyman like you must marry      421.6664313278577
chuse properly chuse a gentlewoman for my sake and for your own let her be an active useful sort of person not brought up high but able to make a small income go a good way      931.8803879127981
 this is my advice      266.67016311176104
 find such a woman as soon as you can bring her to hunsford and i will visit her      320.6178286020415
 you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite      225.9395569549696
 thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i assure you there are many amiable young women      382.40058115017257
 but the fact is that being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father who however may live many years longer i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes placewhich however as i have already said may not be for several years      1064.460002944759
 this has been my motive my fair cousin and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem      1033.1063112622248
 and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection      182.7909633198554
 to fortune i am perfectly indifferent and shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well aware that it could not be complied with and that one thousand pounds in the per cents      865.1666371823322
 which will not be yours till after your mothers decease is all that you may ever be entitled to      402.4209577950454
 on that head therefore i shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married      521.0055306313707
 it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now      827.5845652120538
 you are too hasty sir she cried      44.74640931628707
 you forget that i have made no answer      87.7875892247854
 let me do it without farther loss of time      1229.5237429804772
 accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me      2817.927235834552
 i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them      755.2232017011396
 i am not now to learn replied mr      126.0476611229174
 i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long      736.6946562784208
 upon my word sir cried elizabeth your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration      294.442935584838
 i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time      280.0577037415702
 i am perfectly serious in my refusal      457.17126674288704
you could not make me happy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make you so      265.66429026067544
nay were your friend lady catherine to know me i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation      204.7278839353468
 were it certain that lady catherine would think so said mr      2186.4601159162835
 and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty economy and other amiable qualifications      403.8016217893767
 collins all praise of me will be unnecessary      227.1604716445184
 you must give me leave to judge for myself and pay me the compliment of believing what i say      495.59548354268316
 i wish you very happy and very rich and by refusing your hand do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise      240.34103338865975
 in making me the offer you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls without any selfreproach      562.6645307285653
 this matter may be considered therefore as finally settled      1418.141328129121
 collins thus addressed her when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character      464.9603735337917
 really mr      40.11910197869102
 if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one      299.58554964594293
 you must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course      520.9191626538395
 my reasons for believing it are briefly theseit does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable      546.3333049449623
 my situation in life my connections with the family of de bourgh and my relationship to your own are circumstances highly in my favour and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you      534.0955218957292
 your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications      132.66130110770254
 as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense according to the usual practice of elegant females      627.448896348544
 i do assure you sir that i have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man      255.27274327735893
 i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals but to accept them is absolutely impossible      65.50988701548394
 my feelings in every respect forbid it      2867.939465423552
 can i speak plainer      190.9288693559034
 do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart      358.28125745225753
 you are uniformly charming      40.11910197869102
 cried he with an air of awkward gallantry and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents my proposals will not fail of being acceptable      268.47914257529635
 to such perseverance in wilful selfdeception elizabeth would make no reply and immediately and in silence withdrew determined if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement to apply to her father whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female      834.8170154997837
 chapter xx      620.1082954481221
 collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love for mrs      318.48086433223904
 bennet having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase than she entered the breakfastroom and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection      642.2208129010894
 bennetshe would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals but she dared not to believe it and could not help saying so      599.1771807471138
 collins she added that lizzy shall be brought to reason      378.27007511442713
 i will speak to her about it myself directly      239.906026399863
 pardon me for interrupting you madam cried mr      118.10967858460478
 collins but if she is really headstrong and foolish i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state      560.8874519917459
 sir you quite misunderstand me said mrs      146.94618511039909
 bennet alarmed      2056.6665453882724
 lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these      108.02656366792637
 in every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived      222.28535080620927
 i will go directly to mr      157.92415961152898
 bennet and we shall very soon settle it with her i am sure      790.3259812501911
 she would not give him time to reply but hurrying instantly to her husband called out as she entered the library oh      242.6283818451409
 you must come and make lizzy marry mr      287.24835050978845
 collins for she vows she will not have him and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her      645.6024983114839
 i have not the pleasure of understanding you said he when she had finished her speech      285.4263100832022
 of what are you talking      590.4747726465007
 collins and lizzy      248.94042605864988
 lizzy declares she will not have mr      43.215159672798116
 collins and mr      248.94042605864988
 and what am i to do on the occasion      234.48582746820404
it seems an hopeless business      5015.6278593492525
 speak to lizzy about it yourself      2622.066500569525
 tell her that you insist upon her marrying him      512.5999343888922
 let her be called down      814.6955581649441
 she shall hear my opinion      1074.9972338701825
 bennet rang the bell and miss elizabeth was summoned to the library      556.9222470831662
 i have sent for you on an affair of importance      518.9507520133004
 collins has made you an offer of marriage      227.1604716445184
 is it true      658.5030647809108
 elizabeth replied that it was      215.01817017506332
 very welland this offer of marriage you have refused      512.5999343888922
 i have sir      47.71804916323267
 very well      40.11910197869102
 we now come to the point      493.23587565936685
 your mother insists upon your accepting it      123.55749986770849
 is not it so mrs      246.99101837456777
 yes or i will never see her again      313.24654742626456
 an unhappy alternative is before you elizabeth      44.74640931628707
 from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents      430.7921079604293
your mother will never see you again if you do not marry mr      406.6598676483947
 collins and i will never see you again if you do      161.62502357084864
 elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning but mrs      490.81862507473505
 bennet who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished was excessively disappointed      622.8493735518351
 what do you mean mr      826.340678089009
 bennet by talking in this way      2056.6665453882715
 you promised me to insist upon her marrying him      230.81708400330606
 my dear replied her husband i have two small favours to request      590.0385672122633
 i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be      227.83849542656338
 not yet however in spite of her disappointment in her husband did mrs      706.5180573768505
 bennet give up the point      935.8394474874626
 she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest but jane with all possible mildness declined interferingand elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks      550.3903720330401
 though her manner varied however her determination never did      89.09673705835279
 collins meanwhile was meditating in solitude on what had passed      378.27007511442713
 he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him and though his pride was hurt he suffered in no other way      439.1574230243396
 his regard for her was quite imaginary and the possibility of her deserving her mothers reproach prevented his feeling any regret      257.5297466865975
 while the family were in this confusion charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them      713.4872224013214
 she was met in the vestibule by lydia who flying to her cried in a half whisper i am glad you are come for there is such fun here      1865.7496547199923
what do you think has happened this morning      265.7548253691684
 charlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by kitty who came to tell the same news and no sooner had they entered the breakfastroom where mrs      324.62859232025994
 bennet was alone than she likewise began on the subject calling on miss lucas for her compassion and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family      862.4262116661329
 pray do my dear miss lucas she added in a melancholy tone for nobody is on my side nobody takes part with me i am cruelly used nobody feels for my poor nerves      486.96755491659883
 charlottes reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth      1092.67161588871
 aye there she comes continued mrs      560.2254188625325
but i tell you what miss lizzy if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way you will never get a husband at alland i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead      360.70917813900246
i shall not be able to keep youand so i warn you      165.87300359699285
i have done with you from this very day      110.99212611339227
i told you in the library you know that i should never speak to you again and you will find me as good as my word      139.6789492678775
 i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children      110.99212611339226
not that i have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body      268.83573077892635
 people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking      1681.870809996223
 nobody can tell what i suffer      149.03516866374105
but it is always so      881.809664012692
 those who do not complain are never pitied      1885.9715376448291
 her daughters listened in silence to this effusion sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation      656.2059589931634
 she talked on therefore without interruption from any of them till they were joined by mr      471.9655624417354
 collins and me have a little conversation together      227.1604716445184
 elizabeth passed quietly out of the room jane and kitty followed but lydia stood her ground determined to hear all she could and charlotte detained first by the civility of mr      696.7001469274494
 collins whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute and then by a little curiosity satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear      545.0580879370077
 bennet thus began the projected conversation      2056.6665453882715
 my dear madam replied he let us be for ever silent on this point      448.22647214618837
 far be it from me he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure to resent the behaviour of your daughter      892.1121563276714
 resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment and i trust i am resigned      533.5737344130705
 perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation      867.1096050957278
 you will not i hope consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family my dear madam by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughters favour without having paid yourself and mr      350.2330330218461
 bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf      2080.982841935101
 my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughters lips instead of your own      472.0336705496577
 but we are all liable to error      2960.83542238519
 i have certainly meant well through the whole affair      203.9577656769284
 my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself with due consideration for the advantage of all your family and if my manner has been at all reprehensible i here beg leave to apologise      1006.3961390575138
 chapter xxi      620.1082954481221
 the discussion of mr      1729.4435253892393
 collinss offer was now nearly at an end and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother      503.04400258787575
 as for the gentleman himself his feelings were chiefly expressed not by embarrassment or dejection or by trying to avoid her but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence      1001.9425249007489
 he scarcely ever spoke to her and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all and especially to her friend      578.0486990876744
 the morrow produced no abatement of mrs      1061.4526955302235
 bennets ill humour or ill health      2056.6665453882715
 collins was also in the same state of angry pride      352.93845979286675
 elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it      506.39337127326104
 he was always to have gone on saturday and to saturday he still meant to stay      849.4112531191925
 after breakfast the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr      1302.6835018125528
 wickham were returned and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball      1253.5204437003329
 he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunts where his regret and vexation and the concern of every body was well talked over      584.7593180943768
to elizabeth however he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed      731.3626852462
 i found said he as the time drew near that i had better not meet mr      185.63060021278517
 darcythat to be in the same room the same party with him for so many hours together might be more than i could bear and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself      615.1978598548073
 she highly approved his forbearance and they had leisure for a full discussion of it and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn and during the walk he particularly attended to her      360.11413774679966
 his accompanying them was a double advantage she felt all the compliment it offered to herself and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother      459.7300074908229
 the envelope contained a sheet of elegant little hot pressed paper well covered with a ladys fair flowing hand and elizabeth saw her sisters countenance change as she read it and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages      931.1613263585571
 jane recollected herself soon and putting the letter away tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs      713.37995903049
 when they had gained their own room jane taking out the letter said this is from caroline bingley what it contains has surprised me a good deal      314.6260611042737
 the whole party have left netherfield by this time and are on their way to town and without any intention of coming back again      541.0677517803366
 you shall hear what she says      149.03516866374105
 she then read the first sentence aloud which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street where mr      1233.652998020092
 hurst had a house      40.11910197869102
 i do not pretend to regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire except your society my dearest friend but we will hope at some future period to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence      285.40348067782674
 i depend on you for that      603.7985448863138
 to these high flown expressions elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her she saw nothing in it really to lament it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr      996.5755686078064
 it is unlucky said she after a short pause that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country      303.4089283641785
 but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters      784.2806773872089
 caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter      304.6077755676951
 i will read it to you when my brother left us yesterday he imagined that the business which took him to london might be concluded in three or four days but as we are certain it cannot be so and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again we have determined on following him thither that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel      517.9403208607728
 many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter i wish i could hear that you my dearest friend had any intention of making one in the croud but of that i despair      308.21985482894735
 i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you      550.3826967555945
 it is evident by this added jane that he comes back no more this winter      586.6195648238252
 it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he should      162.5378466980104
 it must be his own doing      537.9233496542191
he is his own master      1038.4850141414397
 but you do not know all      493.23587565936685
 i will read you the passage which particularly hurts me      200.61904655320967
 i will have no reserves from you      129.8478204801193
 darcy is impatient to see his sister and to confess the truth we are scarcely less eager to meet her again      779.2836283478628
 i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject but i will not leave the country without confiding them and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable      433.1422720109131
 my brother admires her greatly already he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing her relations all wish the connection as much as his own and a sisters partiality is not misleading me i think when i call charles most capable of engaging any womans heart      357.3075029348878
 what think you of this sentence my dear lizzy      499.8674050853858
 is it not clear enough      267.3379825681269
does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister that she is perfectly convinced of her brothers indifference and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means most kindly      798.0801641791261
 to put me on my guard      493.23587565936685
 can there be any other opinion on the subject      427.5041642645687
 yes there can for mine is totally different      2056.6665453882724
will you hear it      275.1051068147718
 most willingly      2056.6665453882724
 you shall have it in few words      136.4185399396904
 miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy      2445.9413662964753
 she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you      693.2941969665279
 jane shook her head      48.56388609578208
no one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection      140.67046738788883
 could she have seen half as much love in mr      359.0893646518997
 darcy for herself she would have ordered her wedding clothes      140.095729792484
 but the case is this      814.6955581649441
 we are not rich enough or grand enough for them and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage she may have less trouble in achieving a second in which there is certainly some ingenuity and i dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way      304.75249208607363
 but my dearest jane you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you he is very much in love with her friend      753.2492382717181
 if we thought alike of miss bingley replied jane your representation of all this might make me quite easy      288.52821364126703
 but i know the foundation is unjust      371.25101893105585
 caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one and all that i can hope in this case is that she is deceived herself      435.9144829366454
 believe her to be deceived by all means      2194.892161782015
 you have now done your duty by her and must fret no longer      135.46219192205146
 you must decide for yourself said elizabeth and if upon mature deliberation you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife i advise you by all means to refuse him      538.7986811626932
 how can you talk so      168.68259607116462
said jane faintly smilingyou must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation i could not hesitate      480.5278811536029
 i did not think you wouldand that being the case i cannot consider your situation with much compassion      97.16895628814578
 but if he returns no more this winter my choice will never be required      982.0117284920666
 a thousand things may arise in six months      289.8076920581833
 the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt      418.34209950103076
 it appeared to her merely the suggestion of carolines interested wishes and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes however openly or artfully spoken could influence a young man so totally independent of every one      1123.990733222779
 she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect      1756.9984423915687
 janes temper was not desponding and she was gradually led to hope though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart      876.5941877814673
 bennet should only hear of the departure of the family without being alarmed on the score of the gentlemans conduct but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together      468.5525486272945
 bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that though he had been invited only to a family dinner she would take care to have two full courses      210.60305442088432
 chapter xxii      620.1082954481221
 the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases and again during the chief of the day was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr      1693.0914297428933
 elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her      457.17126674288704
 it keeps him in good humour said she and i am more obliged to you than i can express      523.4994471770586
 charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time      597.5367159517311
 collinss addresses by engaging them towards herself      94.48952093091286
 but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet      707.5377068244557
 he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins from a conviction that if they saw him depart they could not fail to conjecture his design and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise for though feeling almost secure and with reason for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday      425.04863408531855
 his reception however was of the most flattering kind      1164.2135999887166
 miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane      1262.3850276869227
 in as short a time as mr      163.89484864115948
 collinss long speeches would allow every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness      693.5783436920956
 the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance and miss lucas who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment cared not how soon that establishment were gained      570.3470799744026
 sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity      148.44344286524932
 lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before how many years longer mr      189.5054376202584
 bennet was likely to live and sir william gave it as his decided opinion that whenever mr      1063.013798258944
 collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st      465.16654708042415
 jamess      40.11910197869102
 the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion      619.6102706533213
 the younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlottes dying an old maid      430.9142345849217
 charlotte herself was tolerably composed      139.75505364770575
 she had gained her point and had time to consider of it      185.35638155223202
 her reflections were in general satisfactory      149.03516866374105
 collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable his society was irksome and his attachment to her must be imaginary      736.6091990187529
 but still he would be her husband      3269.027341569461
without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony marriage had always been her object it was the only honourable provision for welleducated young women of small fortune and however uncertain of giving happiness must be their pleasantest preservative from want      257.7552037129007
 this preservative she had now obtained and at the age of twentyseven without having ever been handsome she felt all the good luck of it      1053.0563759699035
 she resolved to give her the information herself and therefore charged mr      1197.7516272953342
 collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family      489.84995621743195
 a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given but it could not be kept without difficulty for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade and he was at the same time exercising great selfdenial for he was longing to publish his prosperous love      599.7866475042038
 as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family the ceremony of leavetaking was performed when the ladies moved for the night and mrs      471.42216737815494
 bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them      1463.0974603462053
 my dear madam he replied this invitation is particularly gratifying because it is what i have been hoping to receive and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible      466.1298844896284
 they were all astonished and mr      493.23587565936685
 bennet who could by no means wish for so speedy a return immediately said but is there not danger of lady catherines disapprobation here my good sir      489.3632771043366
you had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness      638.7709892679788
 my dear sir replied mr      193.76542062357612
 you cannot be too much on your guard      87.52082483823872
 risk any thing rather than her displeasure and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again which i should think exceedingly probable stay quietly at home and be satisfied that we shall take no offence      306.42052409197487
 believe me my dear sir my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention and depend upon it you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire      715.7149642817079
 as for my fair cousins though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness not excepting my cousin elizabeth      307.13056149971106
 with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return      560.0087749811406
 she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her and though by no means so clever as herself she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers he might become a very agreeable companion      420.9948425687729
 but on the following morning every hope of this kind was done away      658.4343752391118
 miss lucas called soon after breakfast and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before      905.109642069812
 the possibility of mr      1729.4435253892393
 collinss fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two but that charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum and she could not help crying out engaged to mr      347.2884260292771
 my dear charlotteimpossible      553.6385512922801
 the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach though as it was no more than she expected she soon regained her composure and calmly replied why should you be surprised my dear eliza      806.4501949587975
do you think it incredible that mr      40.11910197869101
 collins should be able to procure any womans good opinion because he was not so happy as to succeed with you      385.5053282476261
 but elizabeth had now recollected herself and making a strong effort for it was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her and that she wished her all imaginable happiness      829.4625263978617
 i see what you are feeling replied charlotteyou must be surprised very much surprisedso lately as mr      432.2971129317267
 collins was wishing to marry you      106.75123397241158
 but when you have had time to think it all over i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done      241.7355400011077
 i am not romantic you know      184.61315922261164
 i never was      47.71804916323267
 i ask only a comfortable home and considering mr      119.87812674913236
 collinss character connections and situation in life i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state      525.8210213601545
 elizabeth quietly answered undoubtedlyand after an awkward pause they returned to the rest of the family      788.9905928883518
 charlotte did not stay much longer and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard      299.3723032760798
 it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match      513.1754600792295
 collinss making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted      359.4698077904096
 charlotte the wife of mr      139.75505364770575
 collins was a most humiliating picture      106.75123397241158
 chapter xxiii      620.1082954481221
 elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters reflecting on what she had heard and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it when sir william lucas himself appeared sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family      780.1598213446982
 with many compliments to them and much selfgratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses he unfolded the matterto an audience not merely wondering but incredulous for mrs      1414.0145401808002
 sir william how can you tell such a story      259.11284023212676
do not you know that mr      132.77524072035618
 collins wants to marry lizzy      119.94930567577303
 nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment but sir williams good breeding carried him through it all and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy      560.161499915928
 elizabeth feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation now put herself forward to confirm his account by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william in which she was readily joined by jane and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match the excellent character of mr      586.1022032362598
 collins and the convenient distance of hunsford from london      202.35592328277272
 in the first place she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter secondly she was very sure that mr      809.6989986316424
 collins had been taken in thirdly she trusted that they would never be happy together and fourthly that the match might be broken off      393.025819980302
 two inferences however were plainly deduced from the whole one that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief and the other that she herself had been barbarously used by them all and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day      811.2555427101425
nor did that day wear out her resentment      42.81544943112701
 a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter      1254.8345647667377
 bennets emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort for it gratified him he said to discover that charlotte lucas whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible was as foolish as his wife and more foolish than his daughter      802.0363991877699
 jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable      1189.2841044108368
 kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas for mr      166.37251194802383
 collins was only a clergyman and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton      286.18181357128645
 lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mrs      163.20712170201696
 bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was though mrs      859.6555677085156
 bennets sour looks and illnatured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away      1231.4224641035282
 between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again      865.1052836376041
 her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious as bingley had now been gone a week and nothing was heard of his return      618.997109445709
 jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again      318.6103849755405
 the promised letter of thanks from mr      1061.4526955302235
 collins arrived on tuesday addressed to their father and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonths abode in the family might have prompted      252.18605183216653
 collinss return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to mrs      756.8763542755141
it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome      651.3741480944906
she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable      395.3318522131714
 such were the gentle murmurs of mrs      832.0214939863021
 bingleys continued absence      631.7212696375212
 neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject      543.1115498152592
 day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter a report which highly incensed mrs      575.8514073826304
 bennet and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood      790.3259812501911
 even elizabeth began to fearnot that bingley was indifferentbut that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away      1139.488515827637
 the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london might be too much she feared for the strength of his attachment      987.0789012508637
 as for jane her anxiety under this suspence was of course more painful than elizabeths but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing and between herself and elizabeth therefore the subject was never alluded to      363.7368132455143
 but as no such delicacy restrained her mother an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley express her impatience for his arrival or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back she should think herself very ill used      570.6073512615659
 it needed all janes steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity      473.4765724509884
 collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction      569.77869084376
 the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed      905.734167090551
 bennet was really in a most pitiable state      1885.9715376448294
 the very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of      329.9754055271143
 the sight of miss lucas was odious to her      586.5929186828645
 as her successor in that house she regarded her with jealous abhorrence      855.9638002731915
 whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession and whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr      1204.3347959094501
 collins was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house as soon as mr      454.6618297534785
 bennet were dead      7640.1422354822
 she complained bitterly of all this to her husband      2635.606375106195
 bennet said she it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house that i should be forced to make way for her and live to see her take my place in it      485.9981466914624
 my dear do not give way to such gloomy thoughts      209.1515882498129
 let us hope for better things      493.23587565936685
 this was not very consoling to mrs      1143.3667619685148
 bennet and therefore instead of making any answer she went on as before i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate      873.9244333392835
 if it was not for the entail i should not mind it      531.1446421179475
 what should not you mind      826.340678089009
 i should not mind any thing at all      124.93451255912733
 i never can be thankful mr      162.5378466980104
 bennet for any thing about the entail      3269.027341569461
 how any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from ones own daughters i cannot understand and all for the sake of mr      167.22014134915491
 collins too      620.1082954481221
why should he have it more than anybody else      230.81708400330606
 i leave it to yourself to determine said mr      266.22604722529286

 chapter i      620.1082954481221
 the very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for the winter and concluded with her brothers regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left the country      1251.337023785609
 hope was over entirely over and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter she found little except the professed affection of the writer that could give her any comfort      383.2803299861865
 miss darcys praise occupied the chief of it      1032.205460861821
 her many attractions were again dwelt on and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter      475.5487996869718
 darcys house and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture      296.67459925673967
 elizabeth to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this heard it in silent indignation      616.5512395777257
 her heart was divided between concern for her sister and resentment against all the others      585.334576295847
 to carolines assertion of her brothers being partial to miss darcy she paid no credit      313.4059827761458
 that he was really fond of jane she doubted no more than she had ever done and much as she had always been disposed to like him she could not think without anger hardly without contempt on that easiness of temper that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations      425.70776865869607
 had his own happiness however been the only sacrifice he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best but her sisters was involved in it as she thought he must be sensible himself      819.601757229586
 it was a subject in short on which reflection would be long indulged and must be unavailing      1534.45962599122
 she could think of nothing else and yet whether bingleys regard had really died away or were suppressed by his friends interference whether he had been aware of janes attachment or whether it had escaped his observation whichever were the case though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference her sisters situation remained the same her peace equally wounded      415.7018924838644
 a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth but at last on mrs      424.4182090510754
 bennets leaving them together after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master she could not help saying oh      1205.4081860544
 that my dear mother had more command over herself she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him      456.1415679316328
 but i will not repine      814.6955581649441
 he will be forgot and we shall all be as we were before      722.8577419482002
 elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude but said nothing      741.6482949915529
 you doubt me cried jane slightly colouring indeed you have no reason      271.12633940637664
 he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance but that is all      255.16111617499902
 i have nothing either to hope or fear and nothing to reproach him with      133.76896966975485
 thank god      1454.2828608835578
 i have not that pain      48.7335340966758
 a little time therefore      48.563886095782074
i shall certainly try to get the better      137.4559491389114
 with a stronger voice she soon added i have this comfort immediately that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side and that it has done no harm to any one but myself      393.72941403848347
 my dear jane      553.6385512922801
 exclaimed elizabeth you are too good      1238.2540060054012
 your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic i do not know what to say to you      2147.7229525445337
 i feel as if i had never done you justice or loved you as you deserve      464.0254127235233
 miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit and threw back the praise on her sisters warm affection      2912.4807356154497
 you wish to think all the world respectable and are hurt if i speak ill of any body      226.428278746604
 i only want to think you perfect and you set yourself against it      133.67375015901717
 do not be afraid of my running into any excess of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will      261.693934196056
 you need not      40.11910197869101
 there are few people whom i really love and still fewer of whom i think well      1788.916484900003
 the more i see of the world the more am i dissatisfied with it and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense      673.372498279703
 i have met with two instances lately one i will not mention the other is charlottes marriage      635.7157412121428
 it is unaccountable      522.6542288787506
 in every view it is unaccountable      162.5378466980104
 my dear lizzy do not give way to such feelings as these      165.87300359699287
 they will ruin your happiness      814.6955581649441
 you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper      72.98509041376339
 consider mr      620.1082954481221
 collinss respectability and charlottes prudent steady character      94.48952093091286
 remember that she is one of a large family that as to fortune it is a most eligible match and be ready to believe for every bodys sake that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin      944.251317795699
 to oblige you i would try to believe almost any thing but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him i should only think worse of her understanding than i now do of her heart      361.05796261429816
 my dear jane mr      287.24835050978845
 collins is a conceited pompous narrowminded silly man you know he is as well as i do and you must feel as well as i do that the woman who marries him cannot have a proper way of thinking      620.7585262172514
 you shall not defend her though it is charlotte lucas      102.00034256777222
 you shall not for the sake of one individual change the meaning of principle and integrity nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me that selfishness is prudence and insensibility of danger security for happiness      306.8674281220944
 i must think your language too strong in speaking of both replied jane and i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together      184.83645441395336
 but enough of this      1729.4435253892393
 you alluded to something else      40.119101978691035
 you mentioned two instances      40.11910197869102
 i cannot misunderstand you but i intreat you dear lizzy not to pain me by thinking that person to blame and saying your opinion of him is sunk      289.00868958176295
 we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured      1350.0815554445055
 we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect      2265.718649024234
 it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us      313.2732279101
 women fancy admiration means more than it does      1542.282332914452
 and men take care that they should      424.4182090510754
 if it is designedly done they cannot be justified but i have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine      420.887871336702
 i am far from attributing any part of mr      242.3590892531792
 bingleys conduct to design said elizabeth but without scheming to do wrong or to make others unhappy there may be error and there may be misery      530.0840439274937
 thoughtlessness want of attention to other peoples feelings and want of resolution will do the business      2147.7229525445337
 yes to the last      2056.6665453882724
 but if i go on i shall displease you by saying what i think of persons you esteem      143.0207154927589
 you persist then in supposing his sisters influence him      553.6385512922801
 yes in conjunction with his friend      663.8157882572414
 why should they try to influence him      380.52835234615804
 they can only wish his happiness and if he is attached to me no other woman can secure it      289.7069839104904
 your first position is false      40.119101978691035
 beyond a doubt they do wish him to chuse miss darcy replied jane but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing      279.8973254532853
 they have known her much longer than they have known me no wonder if they love her better      222.97502619634295
 but whatever may be their own wishes it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brothers      993.9175119126735
 what sister would think herself at liberty to do it unless there were something very objectionable      1249.3201891365177
 if they believed him attached to me they would not try to part us if he were so they could not succeed      679.5387257228983
 by supposing such an affection you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong and me most unhappy      1038.9402492158433
 do not distress me by the idea      111.90895152746809
 i am not ashamed of having been mistakenor at least it is slight it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters      427.56066512175954
 let me take it in the best light in the light in which it may be understood      1002.8482651099356
 elizabeth could not oppose such a wish and from this time mr      917.9383034404899
 bingleys name was scarcely ever mentioned between them      306.5539012303626
 bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity      415.01594108874536
 her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking which ceased when he saw her no more but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time she had the same story to repeat every day      322.1972462296883
 bennets best comfort was that mr      2056.6665453882715
 bingley must be down again in the summer      306.5539012303626
 bennet treated the matter differently      935.8394474874626
 so lizzy said he one day your sister is crossed in love i find      155.18931267025013
 next to being married a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then      939.2843228443442
 it is something to think of and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions      847.3926044640946
 when is your turn to come      493.23587565936685
 you will hardly bear to be long outdone by jane      86.65830354848481
 now is your time      241.5461082312236
 here are officers enough at meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country      701.0818506186913
 let wickham be your man      814.6955581649441
 he is a pleasant fellow and would jilt you creditably      518.9507520133004
 we must not all expect janes good fortune      5046.477071100452
 true said mr      439.4232093657577
 bennet but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befal you you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it      1152.873650973588
 wickhams society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family      1117.1129072972183
 they saw him often and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve      721.2335530740734
 the whole of what elizabeth had already heard his claims on mr      493.23587565936685
 darcy and all that he had suffered from him was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked mr      188.16463613011055
 darcy before they had known any thing of the matter      676.6280069086736
 miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of hertfordshire her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances and urged the possibility of mistakesbut by everybody else mr      819.4988846370427
 after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity mr      1357.1075919631303
 he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before wished his fair cousins health and happiness again and promised their father another letter of thanks      330.4513439706702
 on the following monday mrs      168.68259607116462
 bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn      1179.8860446721776
 the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade and within view of his own warehouses could have been so well bred and agreeable      489.52236503872655
 gardiner who was several years younger than mrs      126.0476611229174
 bennet and mrs      7640.1422354822
 philips was an amiable intelligent elegant woman and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces      576.1411848625214
 between the two eldest and herself especially there subsisted a very particular regard      4347.780197770786
 they had frequently been staying with her in town      232.64422394788394
 the first part of mrs      814.6955581649441
 gardiners business on her arrival was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions      401.8259903991702
 when this was done she had a less active part to play      992.7875149427447
 bennet had many grievances to relate and much to complain of      707.380452269879
 they had all been very illused since she last saw her sister      159.77583019203004
 two of her girls had been on the point of marriage and after all there was nothing in it      290.0784584539819
 i do not blame jane she continued for jane would have got mr      137.65192811974424
 bingley if she could      327.15695039771015
 but lizzy      2056.6665453882724
 oh sister      40.11910197869102
 collinss wife by this time had not it been for her own perverseness      696.0528261648016
 he made her an offer in this very room and she refused him      479.8112886909558
 the consequence of it is that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have and that longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever      1061.0791706749105
 the lucases are very artful people indeed sister      522.285391316768
 they are all for what they can get      289.8076920581833
 i am sorry to say it of them but so it is      175.73632566154058
 it makes me very nervous and poorly to be thwarted so in my own family and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else      660.8475197546834
 however your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts and i am very glad to hear what you tell us of long sleeves      302.7471207991649
 gardiner to whom the chief of this news had been given before in the course of jane and elizabeths correspondence with her made her sister a slight answer and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation      446.042151626288
 when alone with elizabeth afterwards she spoke more on the subject      345.76260499920585
 it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane said she      1736.0585134649527
 i am sorry it went off      184.61315922261164
 but these things happen so often      1632.3773188485725
 a young man such as you describe mr      44.13999885317416
 bingley so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks and when accident separates them so easily forgets her that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent      266.3110724926681
 an excellent consolation in its way said elizabeth but it will not do for us      1072.9278652032974
 we do not suffer by accident      493.23587565936685
 it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before      737.6432726462489
 but that expression of violently in love is so hackneyed so doubtful so indefinite that it gives me very little idea      1664.383415318117
 it is as often applied to feelings which arise from an halfhours acquaintance as to a real strong attachment      1161.7854085500844
 pray how violent was mr      225.75951233528167
 bingleys love      2056.6665453882724
 i never saw a more promising inclination      409.89435694249676
 he was growing quite inattentive to other people and wholly engrossed by her      468.9615049624668
 every time they met it was more decided and remarkable      919.8092890604498
 at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance and i spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer      471.6433563090072
 could there be finer symptoms      119.94930567577303
 is not general incivility the very essence of love      244.55606762089144
of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt      249.0722377485309
 poor jane      2056.6665453882724
 it had better have happened to you lizzy you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner      633.1716693214728
 but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us      196.39199472039385
 change of scene might be of serviceand perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything      869.244472080843
 elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal and felt persuaded of her sisters ready acquiescence      1024.3432230674102
 i hope added mrs      45.693014538637115
 gardiner that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her      145.9853040041972
 we live in so different a part of town all our connections are so different and as you well know we go out so little that it is very improbable they should meet at all unless he really comes to see her      506.3797435725086
 and that is quite impossible for he is now in the custody of his friend and mr      274.27250337515875
 my dear aunt how could you think of it      251.26965977195474
 darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as gracechurch street but he would hardly think a months ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities were he once to enter it and depend upon it mr      379.79275963505216
 bingley never stirs without him      215.01817017506332
 so much the better      341.5977821990359
 i hope they will not meet at all      306.5539012303626
 but does not jane correspond with the sister      704.8260778148694
 she will not be able to help calling      820.2760236494913
 but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point as well as the still more interesting one of bingleys being withheld from seeing jane she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her on examination that she did not consider it entirely hopeless      753.2075965522072
 miss bennet accepted her aunts invitation with pleasure and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time than as she hoped that by carolines not living in the same house with her brother she might occasionally spend a morning with her without any danger of seeing him      1038.4034580668458
 the gardiners staid a week at longbourn and what with the philipses the lucases and the officers there was not a day without its engagement      553.9767564105871
 bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister that they did not once sit down to a family dinner      499.3042787006907
 when the engagement was for home some of the officers always made part of it of which officers mr      1068.9855257864338
 wickham was sure to be one and on these occasions mrs      583.462744539963
 gardiner rendered suspicious by elizabeths warm commendation of him narrowly observed them both      148.71625457976438
 without supposing them from what she saw to be very seriously in love their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment      1083.8605466789593
 to mrs      1454.2828608835578
 they had therefore many acquaintance in common and though wickham had been little there since the death of darcys father five years before it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring      435.5947163715509
 gardiner had seen pemberley and known the late mr      110.99212611339226
 darcy by character perfectly well      139.75505364770575
 here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse      569.5562578890355
 in comparing her recollection of pemberley with the minute description which wickham could give and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor she was delighting both him and herself      388.24805833028324
 on being made acquainted with the present mr      306.5539012303626
 darcys treatment of him she tried to remember something of that gentlemans reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it and was confident at last that she recollected having heard mr      944.8258435817985
 fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud illnatured boy      314.18774831005356
 gardiners caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone after honestly telling her what she thought she thus went on you are too sensible a girl lizzy to fall in love merely because you are warned against it and therefore i am not afraid of speaking openly      276.4815346488998
 seriously i would have you be on your guard      684.277674053273
 do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent      171.93874126484988
 i have nothing to say against him he is a most interesting young man and if he had the fortune he ought to have i should think you could not do better      198.5143304329897
 but as it isyou must not let your fancy run away with you      903.0894872392339
 you have sense and we all expect you to use it      179.99869314869713
 your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct i am sure      219.33062690079467
 you must not disappoint your father      149.03516866374105
 my dear aunt this is being serious indeed      316.0375291753207
 i will take care of myself and of mr      222.12292316896026
 wickham too      1454.2828608835578
 he shall not be in love with me if i can prevent it      261.8317792067527
 elizabeth you are not serious now      175.26129507828713
 i beg your pardon      327.15695039771015
 i will try again      275.1051068147718
 at present i am not in love with mr      3467.4896385701213
 wickham no i certainly am not      360.70731406284415
 but he is beyond all comparison the most agreeable man i ever sawand if he becomes really attached to mei believe it will be better that he should not      462.7119312121929
 i see the imprudence of it      2517.6843954461397
 that abominable mr      439.4232093657577
my fathers opinion of me does me the greatest honour and i should be miserable to forfeit it      559.6818196409273
 my father however is partial to mr      940.7078632487163
 in short my dear aunt i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy but since we see every day that where there is affection young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist      325.64465834173103
 all that i can promise you therefore is not to be in a hurry      197.84078588688416
 i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object      240.4094773513949
 in short i will do my best      146.94618511039909
 perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often      1007.8329034967716
 at least you should not remind your mother of inviting him      758.2652220802573
 as i did the other day said elizabeth with a conscious smile very true it will be wise in me to refrain from that      223.72637320234122
 but do not imagine that he is always here so often      302.8611556594435
 but really and upon my honour i will try to do what i think to be wisest and now i hope you are satisfied      214.23198564638443
 her aunt assured her that she was and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints they parted a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point without being resented      692.5721548170795
 collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the gardiners and jane but as he took up his abode with the lucases his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs      390.33505903570625
 his marriage was now fast approaching and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable and even repeatedly to say in an illnatured tone that she wished they might be happy      624.9883019860782
 that you certainly shall      270.45643337730826
 and i have another favour to ask      48.199563998586285
 will you come and see me      144.80475927254847
 we shall often meet i hope in hertfordshire      845.6522872991771
 i am not likely to leave kent for some time      205.56899392350272
 elizabeth could not refuse though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit      917.9383034404899
 my father and maria are to come to me in march added charlotte and i hope you will consent to be of the party      312.71052732823034
 indeed eliza you will be as welcome to me as either of them      276.9304709352566
 elizabeth soon heard from her friend and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been that it should be equally unreserved was impossible      420.37542524029806
 elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent it was for the sake of what had been rather than what was      516.3744620029372
 she wrote cheerfully seemed surrounded with comforts and mentioned nothing which she could not praise      2175.988272225721
 the house furniture neighbourhood and roads were all to her taste and lady catherines behaviour was most friendly and obliging      577.457200566762
 it was mr      522.6542288787506
 collinss picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the rest      455.71742561984354
 jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in london and when she wrote again elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys      362.26710394046677
 her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is      1069.0696675974566
 jane had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing from caroline      424.4182090510754
 she accounted for it however by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn had by some accident been lost      539.6115569385198
 my aunt she continued is going tomorrow into that part of the town and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenorstreet      407.37521516522264
 she wrote again when the visit was paid and she had seen miss bingley      693.2264396068615
 i did not think caroline in spirits were her words but she was very glad to see me and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london      185.80856841431435
 i was right therefore my last letter had never reached her      197.8605666663534
 he was well but so much engaged with mr      1338.4711704261013
 darcy that they scarcely ever saw him      97.83758319273011
 i found that miss darcy was expected to dinner      85.26223941522618
 i wish i could see her      586.6595363047983
 hurst were going out      40.11910197869102
 i dare say i shall soon see them here      266.22604722529286
 elizabeth shook her head over this letter      457.17126674288704
 it convinced her that accident only could discover to mr      157.84575020783433
 bingley her sisters being in town      162.5378466980104
 four weeks passed away and jane saw nothing of him      743.3636963080631
 she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it but she could no longer be blind to miss bingleys inattention      727.6715173968487
 after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her the visitor did at last appear but the shortness of her stay and yet more the alteration of her manner would allow jane to deceive herself no longer      348.0172244404145
 the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt      1537.9562945257323
 my dearest lizzy will i am sure be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment at my expence when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss bingleys regard for me      377.25352406533574
 i do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me but if the same circumstances were to happen again i am sure i should be deceived again      272.08370352341854
 caroline did not return my visit till yesterday and not a note not a line did i receive in the mean time      219.51559579124273
 when she did come it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it she made a slight formal apology for not calling before said not a word of wishing to see me again and was in every respect so altered a creature that when she went away i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer      577.1416967267976
 i pity though i cannot help blaming her      300.00424627721026
 she was very wrong in singling me out as she did i can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side      420.7124907885696
 but i pity her because she must feel that she has been acting wrong and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it      1192.899059060995
 i need not explain myself farther and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless yet if she feels it it will easily account for her behaviour to me and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf is natural and amiable      426.53518257817507
 i cannot but wonder however at her having any such fears now because if he had at all cared about me we must have met long long ago      438.77572597723304
 i cannot understand it      179.6420407155711
 if i were not afraid of judging harshly i should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this      296.35765597228124
 but i will endeavour to banish every painful thought and think only of what will make me happy your affection and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt      338.743526138344
 let me hear from you very soon      3269.027341569461
 miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again of giving up the house but not with any certainty      705.752813786828
 we had better not mention it      531.8463367350109
 i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at hunsford      1529.2876382877746
 pray go to see them with sir william and maria      195.1453320693975
 i am sure you will be very comfortable there      287.54003505248056
 yours c      40.11910197869102
 this letter gave elizabeth some pain but her spirits returned as she considered that jane would no longer be duped by the sister at least      981.174868029439
 his character sunk on every review of it and as a punishment for him as well as a possible advantage to jane she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr      369.2916035398166
 darcys sister as by wickhams account she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away      1091.2492880583272
 gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman and required information and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself      503.6856927328674
 his apparent partiality had subsided his attentions were over he was the admirer of some one else      762.312716297639
 elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all but she could see it and write of it without material pain      1276.5432712051593
 the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable but elizabeth less clearsighted perhaps in his case than in charlottes did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence      376.43832154695997
 nothing on the contrary could be more natural and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both and could very sincerely wish him happy      264.4782390227551
 all this was acknowledged to mrs      150.80830190564933
 but my feelings are not only cordial towards him they are even impartial towards miss king      1124.7654063794494
 i cannot find out that i hate her at all or that i am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl      201.32834790324452
 there can be no love in all this      1397.529707761241
 my watchfulness has been effectual and though i should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance were i distractedly in love with him i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance      1866.5515949308885
 importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly      1143.3667619685148
 kitty and lydia take his defection much more to heart than i do      133.67375015901717
 they are young in the ways of the world and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain      349.0272571884597
 chapter iv      620.1082954481221
 with no greater events than these in the longbourn family and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton sometimes dirty and sometimes cold did january and february pass away      626.4886092417992
 march was to take elizabeth to hunsford      301.3169930576569
 she had not at first thought very seriously of going thither but charlotte she soon found was depending on the plan and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty      502.69162726383445
 absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte again and weakened her disgust of mr      566.4761480174401
 there was novelty in the scheme and as with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters home could not be faultless a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake      1005.4673882652487
 every thing however went on smoothly and was finally settled according to charlottes first sketch      191.54636047028347
 the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time and the plan became perfect as plan could be      1515.4864668472062
 the only pain was in leaving her father who would certainly miss her and who when it came to the point so little liked her going that he told her to write to him and almost promised to answer her letter      284.82979160994506
 the farewell between herself and mr      1401.190606069865
 wickham was perfectly friendly on his side even more      452.9506026625008
 her fellowtravellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable      566.5877093213224
 sir william lucas and his daughter maria a good humoured girl but as emptyheaded as himself had nothing to say that could be worth hearing and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise      264.62802638572316
 elizabeth loved absurdities but she had known sir williams too long      741.6482949915529
 he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood and his civilities were worn out like his information      265.44400428648237
 as they drove to mr      1090.363061731885
 on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls whose eagerness for their cousins appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawingroom and whose shyness as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth prevented their coming lower      771.4680220422181
 all was joy and kindness      46.74347398462845
 the day passed most pleasantly away the morning in bustle and shopping and the evening at one of the theatres      1550.311636669056
 their first subject was her sister and she was more grieved than astonished to hear in reply to her minute enquiries that though jane always struggled to support her spirits there were periods of dejection      1751.6195887059314
 it was reasonable however to hope that they would not continue long      1194.6764211736083
 gardiner gave her the particulars also of miss bingleys visit in gracechurchstreet and repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and herself which proved that the former had from her heart given up the acquaintance      299.123562657437
 gardiner then rallied her niece on wickhams desertion and complimented her on bearing it so well      182.2140213258383
 but my dear elizabeth she added what sort of girl is miss king      454.898293933996
 i should be sorry to think our friend mercenary      110.12041675515418
 pray my dear aunt what is the difference in matrimonial affairs between the mercenary and the prudent motive      252.26222028401133
 where does discretion end and avarice begin      1061.4526955302235
 if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is i shall know what to think      125.48900455691823
 she is a very good kind of girl i believe      556.1976443711081
 i know no harm of her      43.75391731724056
 but he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfathers death made her mistress of this fortune      369.4150163979521
 nowhy should he      40.11910197869101
 if it was not allowable for him to gain my affections because i had no money what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about and who was equally poor      374.95218621290843
 but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event      4315.764649792315
 a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe      663.6403842801517
 if she does not object to it why should we      409.3023647232032
 her not objecting does not justify him      123.55749986770849
 it only shews her being deficient in something herselfsense or feeling      176.05412985736186
 well cried elizabeth have it as you choose      522.285391316768
 he shall be mercenary and she shall be foolish      271.38624312485604
 i should be sorry you know to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire      213.14688816713766
 thank heaven      1454.2828608835578
 take care lizzy that speech savours strongly of disappointment      465.38507480803906
 we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us said mrs      431.2788437900727
 gardiner but perhaps to the lakes      48.67533438014639
 no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful      360.3657338998738
 my dear dear aunt she rapturously cried what delight      251.26965977195474
 what felicity      1454.2828608835578
 you give me fresh life and vigour      42.45296161159391
 adieu to disappointment and spleen      250.52146603727175
 what are men to rocks and mountains      371.399249822332
 what hours of transport we shall spend      348.16526261803807
 and when we do return it shall not be like other travellers without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing      295.5226795852924
 lakes mountains and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation      414.35429091943524
 every object in the next days journey was new and interesting to elizabeth and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight      502.95975986565935
 when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford every eye was in search of the parsonage and every turning expected to bring it in view      446.3074372517862
 the paling of rosings park was their boundary on one side      362.5124862393912
 elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants      1321.3847107690965
 at length the parsonage was discernible      560.2254188625325
 the garden sloping to the road the house standing in it the green pales and the laurel hedge every thing declared they were arriving      397.0997130796644
 in a moment they were all out of the chaise rejoicing at the sight of each other      642.209642530623
 collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately received      601.4792842856598
 she saw instantly that her cousins manners were not altered by his marriage his formal civility was just what it had been and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family      745.4756342815696
 they were then with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance taken into the house and as soon as they were in the parlour he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode and punctually repeated all his wifes offers of refreshment      461.8862311371009
 elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room its aspect and its furniture he addressed himself particularly to her as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him      579.0783283262814
 collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed which certainly was not unseldom she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte      157.88602760905408
 after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room from the sideboard to the fender to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london mr      298.706066326775
 collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden which was large and well laid out and to the cultivation of which he attended himself      547.4647482046254
 to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise and owned she encouraged it as much as possible      269.26253079379893
 here leading the way through every walk and cross walk and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind      287.0023047967661
 he could number the fields in every direction and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump      477.8608309932707
 but of all the views which his garden or which the country or the kingdom could boast none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house      368.2431377590546
 it was a handsome modern building well situated on rising ground      388.5894924055748
 from his garden mr      192.09454952389007
 collins would have led them round his two meadows but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost turned back and while sir william accompanied him charlotte took her sister and friend over the house extremely well pleased probably to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husbands help      441.83213245715496
 it was rather small but well built and convenient and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit      737.6135313439264
 collins could be forgotten there was really a great air of comfort throughout and by charlottes evident enjoyment of it elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten      433.92957572284894
 she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country      179.34230562767658
 it was spoken of again while they were at dinner when mr      1187.6324326164536
 collins joining in observed yes miss elizabeth you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church and i need not say you will be delighted with her      323.19990628671746
 she is all affability and condescension and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over      395.535129804761
 i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here      491.6779737483712
 her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming      768.6182880412397
 her ladyships carriage is regularly ordered for us      118.10967858460478
 lady catherine is a very respectable sensible woman indeed added charlotte and a most attentive neighbour      269.12986413765776
 very true my dear that is exactly what i say      397.3157780758141
 she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference      1342.924737315136
 the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news and telling again what had been already written and when it closed elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlottes degree of contentment to understand her address in guiding and composure in bearing with her husband and to acknowledge that it was all done very well      527.7532849360141
 she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass the quiet tenor of their usual employments the vexatious interruptions of mr      350.0780404305251
 collins and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings      202.35592328277272
 a lively imagination soon settled it all      148.44344286524932
 about the middle of the next day as she was in her room getting ready for a walk a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion and after listening a moment she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry and calling loudly after her      683.0319177959578
 pray make haste and come into the diningroom for there is such a sight to be seen      739.3317794569579
 i will not tell you what it is      112.1177133433459
 make haste and come down this moment      424.4182090510754
 elizabeth asked questions in vain maria would tell her nothing more and down they ran into the diningroom which fronted the lane in quest of this wonder it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate      414.58907142614936
 and is this all      48.563886095782074
 cried elizabeth      620.1082954481221
 i expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter      2505.930670700966
 la      40.11910197869102
 my dear said maria quite shocked at the mistake it is not lady catherine      263.74221909466445
 the old lady is mrs      814.6955581649441
 jenkinson who lives with them      193.76542062357612
 the other is miss de bourgh      493.23587565936685
 she is quite a little creature      663.8157882572414
 who would have thought she could be so thin and small      148.03640925877218
 why does she not come in      132.77524072035618
 charlotte says she hardly ever does      113.50930596523533
 it is the greatest of favours when miss de bourgh comes in      569.9099365527761
 i like her appearance said elizabeth struck with other ideas      215.01817017506332
 she looks sickly and cross      1074.9972338701825
yes she will do for him very well      2445.8024889638004
 she will make him a very proper wife      820.2760236494913
 collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies and sir william to elizabeths high diversion was stationed in the doorway in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that way      454.10050090209785
 at length there was nothing more to be said the ladies drove on and the others returned into the house      879.387402467896
 collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune which charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next day      410.2377649004403
 chapter vi      620.1082954481221
 collinss triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete      485.37152566263853
 the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife was exactly what he had wished for and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of lady catherines condescension as he knew not how to admire enough      488.28516168055353
 i confess said he that i should not have been at all surprised by her ladyships asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at rosings      615.9499315212595
 who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after your arrival      189.76094560149582
 i am the less surprised at what has happened replied sir william from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire      898.3169500761733
 about the court such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon      664.1813722340471
 scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to rosings      343.3675500516202
 collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect that the sight of such rooms so many servants and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them      460.26923223272246
 when the ladies were separating for the toilette he said to elizabeth do not make yourself uneasy my dear cousin about your apparel      1225.2434106517437
 i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest there is no occasion for any thing more      285.37426170339137
 lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed      225.68817259455523
 she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved      633.5553945886904
 while they were dressing he came two or three times to their different doors to recommend their being quick as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner      944.317912682058
such formidable accounts of her ladyship and her manner of living quite frightened maria lucas who had been little used to company and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at st      416.5471097791919
 jamess      40.11910197869102
every park has its beauty and its prospects and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with though she could not be in such raptures as mr      682.4172985123578
 when they ascended the steps to the hall marias alarm was every moment increasing and even sir william did not look perfectly calm      1079.2413782719236
elizabeths courage did not fail her      685.8043167791193
 she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue and the mere stateliness of money and rank she thought she could witness without trepidation      164.18390817505343
 from the entrance hall of which mr      843.427557082101
 collins pointed out with a rapturous air the fine proportion and finished ornaments they followed the servants through an antichamber to the room where lady catherine her daughter and mrs      309.48712523026126
 jenkinson were sitting      553.6385512922801
her ladyship with great condescension arose to receive them and as mrs      338.7117961722403
 collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers it was performed in a proper manner without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary      448.11172074549376
 in spite of having been at st      478.88696302013614
 jamess sir william was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow and take his seat without saying a word and his daughter frightened almost out of her senses sat on the edge of her chair not knowing which way to look      856.223179279983
lady catherine was a tall large woman with stronglymarked features which might once have been handsome      421.5742756515984
 her air was not conciliating nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank      299.1404475169291
 she was not rendered formidable by silence but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as marked her selfimportance and brought mr      660.2850885765108
 wickham immediately to elizabeths mind and from the observation of the day altogether she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had represented      725.4274452752196
 when after examining the mother in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr      1435.9595386288931
 darcy she turned her eyes on the daughter she could almost have joined in marias astonishment at her being so thin and so small      372.5440312781322
 there was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies      1073.4043398695117
 jenkinson in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes      584.5191634526954
 after sitting a few minutes they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view mr      992.3175098348803
 the dinner was exceedingly handsome and there were all the servants and all the articles of plate which mr      947.9559705584714
 collins had promised and as he had likewise foretold he took his seat at the bottom of the table by her ladyships desire and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater      270.31360794339435
he carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity and every dish was commended first by him and then by sir william who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear      398.0802625633946
 but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration and gave most gracious smiles especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them      1078.2092926344671
 the party did not supply much conversation      1132.2862363621482
 jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate pressing her to try some other dish and fearing she were indisposed      519.8930782086273
 maria thought speaking out of the question and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire      299.38811800727507
 when the ladies returned to the drawingroom there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk which she did without any intermission till coffee came in delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted      586.138055155077
 elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great ladys attention which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others      512.0401906572455
 in the intervals of her discourse with mrs      281.1111668884079
 collins she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth but especially to the latter of whose connections she knew the least and who she observed to mrs      398.4345830033314
 collins was a very genteel pretty kind of girl      202.35592328277272
 she asked her at different times how many sisters she had whether they were older or younger than herself whether any of them were likely to be married whether they were handsome where they had been educated what carriage her father kept and what had been her mothers maiden name      1298.6680694424863
elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered them very composedly      1404.8429649897469
lady catherine then observed your fathers estate is entailed on mr      298.039648398727
 for your sake turning to charlotte i am glad of it but otherwise i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line      198.3124406634183
it was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourghs family      696.3565090071206
do you play and sing miss bennet      40.11910197869101
 a little      50.29742447128457
 thensome time or other we shall be happy to hear you      2762.0722642743553
 our instrument is a capital one probably superior toyou shall try it some day      394.93850696445935
do your sisters play and sing      40.11910197869101
 one of them does      287.24835050978845
you ought all to have learned      40.11910197869101
 the miss webbs all play and their father has not so good an income as yours      5936.850058405877
do you draw      40.11910197869101
 no not at all      40.11910197869102
 what none of you      270.45643337730826
 not one      40.11910197869102
 that is very strange      270.45643337730826
 but i suppose you had no opportunity      371.25101893105585
 your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters      327.5301616104629
 my mother would have had no objection but my father hates london      950.6560965826181
 has your governess left you      259.3295804444709
 we never had any governess      814.6955581649441
 no governess      40.11910197869102
 how was that possible      241.5461082312236
 five daughters brought up at home without a governess      222.63180645799397
i never heard of such a thing      409.8943569424968
 your mother must have been quite a slave to your education      322.55957517257986
 elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been the case      490.81862507473505
 who attended to you      241.5461082312236
 without a governess you must have been neglected      632.5192817474128
 compared with some families i believe we were but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means      1267.5165799062054
 we were always encouraged to read and had all the masters that were necessary      1126.6927233278604
 those who chose to be idle certainly might      1885.9715376448291
 i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction and nobody but a governess can give it      319.93274667362954
 it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way      434.24360600439184
 i am always glad to get a young person well placed out      342.74159095560793
 four nieces of mrs      192.09454952389007
 jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means and it was but the other day that i recommended another young person who was merely accidentally mentioned to me and the family are quite delighted with her      453.8076277702613
 collins did i tell you of lady metcalfes calling yesterday to thank me      128.01616432076315
 she finds miss pope a treasure      1765.3895395023778
 lady catherine said she you have given me a treasure      165.73101502121398
 are any of your younger sisters out miss bennet      114.03909965182777
 yes maam all      553.6385512922801
 all      40.11910197869102
what all five out at once      538.1739332862631
 very odd      40.11910197869102
the younger ones out before the elder are married      213.70770124255236
your younger sisters must be very young      40.11910197869101
 yes my youngest is not sixteen      2308.530143225881
 perhaps she is full young to be much in company      2379.314080431227
the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first      485.4948517301252
 and to be kept back on such a motive      232.64422394788394
i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind      170.00503738669875
 upon my word said her ladyship you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person      273.90570557705854
 with three younger sisters grown up replied elizabeth smiling your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it      507.70320357355564
 lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence      852.0555093034785
 you cannot be more than twenty i am suretherefore you need not conceal your age      280.4656734936235
 i am not one and twenty      184.61315922261164
 when the gentlemen had joined them and tea was over the card tables were placed      814.6955581649438
 collins sat down to quadrille and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino the two girls had the honour of assisting mrs      271.4873613298662
 jenkinson to make up her party      159.19827272522738
 their table was superlatively stupid      881.809664012692
 scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game except when mrs      488.37994338962153
 jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de bourghs being too hot or too cold or having too much or too little light      1076.2757128662731
 lady catherine was generally speakingstating the mistakes of the three others or relating some anecdote of herself      367.1001146789596
 collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her ladyship said thanking her for every fish he won and apologising if he thought he won too many      427.0457669717142
 sir william did not say much      603.7985448863138
 he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names      2219.978534270396
 when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose the tables were broke up the carriage was offered to mrs      275.8531182131683
 collins gratefully accepted and immediately ordered      106.75123397241158
 the party then gathered round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow      759.1563659173305
 from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr      1668.7603449955275
 as soon as they had driven from the door elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings which for charlottes sake she made more favourable than it really was      301.1948713827039
 but her commendation though costing her some trouble could by no means satisfy mr      1649.2122400148176
 collins and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyships praise into his own hands      171.05016577260184
 chapter vii      620.1082954481221
 sir william staid only a week at hunsford but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughters being most comfortably settled and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with      355.50454961646705
 while sir william was with them mr      371.25101893105585
 collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig and shewing him the country but when he went away the whole family returned to their usual employments and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writing and looking out of window in his own book room which fronted the road      248.0048437857532
 elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the diningparlour for common use it was a better sized room and had a pleasanter aspect but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did for mr      575.6783906186197
 collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement      223.64333981491592
 from the drawingroom they could distinguish nothing in the lane and were indebted to mr      489.862378275786
 collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton which he never failed coming to inform them of though it happened almost every day      433.46029575829766
 she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage and had a few minutes conversation with charlotte but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out      698.3032236527768
 very few days passed in which mr      302.3668411897292
 now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits      418.7884878255653
 she examined into their employments looked at their work and advised them to do it differently found fault with the arrangement of the furniture or detected the housemaid in negligence and if she accepted any refreshment seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that mrs      848.2855224519752
 collinss joints of meat were too large for her family      405.4198281792533
 elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county she was a most active magistrate in her own parish the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by mr      591.5268059599229
 collins and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome discontented or too poor she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences silence their complaints and scold them into harmony and plenty      379.2761490840557
 the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week and allowing for the loss of sir william and there being only one card table in the evening every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first      542.7826455308112
 their other engagements were few as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general was beyond the collinses reach      628.0717319685425
 this however was no evil to elizabeth and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough there were half hours of pleasant conversation with charlotte and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment out of doors      457.9894190503109
 her favourite walk and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine was along the open grove which edged that side of the park where there was a nice sheltered path which no one seemed to value but herself and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherines curiosity      513.6851171604999
 in this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away      278.3864406671409
 easter was approaching and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at rosings which in so small a circle must be important      594.9492081835598
 elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that mr      1418.141328129121
 darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingleys designs on him were by his behaviour to his cousin for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself      743.3297924987543
 his arrival was soon known at the parsonage for mr      113.18803399270442
 collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane in order to have the earliest assurance of it and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park hurried home with the great intelligence      366.6469205494306
 on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects      237.095990722114
 there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them for mr      1832.2815889285312
 darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam the younger son of his uncle lord and to the great surprise of all the party when mr      168.66075742408722
 collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him      106.75123397241158
 darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me      135.90358916986435
 elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment before their approach was announced by the doorbell and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room      819.0999308806478
 elizabeth merely curtseyed to him without saying a word      1418.141328129121
 collins sat for some time without speaking to any body      378.27007511442713
 at length however his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of elizabeth after the health of her family      398.72802163073663
 she answered him in the usual way and after a moments pause added my eldest sister has been in town these three months      671.2217406711404
 have you never happened to see her there      118.1096785846048
 she was perfectly sensible that he never had but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet      1347.2856053153143
 the subject was pursued no farther and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away      2194.9501074135133
 chapter viii      620.1082954481221
 it was some days however before they received any invitation thither for while there were visitors in the house they could not be necessary and it was not till easterday almost a week after the gentlemens arrival that they were honoured by such an attention and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening      714.6813040649731
 for the last week they had seen very little of either lady catherine or her daughter      1093.612538987591
 colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time but mr      410.76264536205724
 darcy they had only seen at church      97.83758319273011
 the invitation was accepted of course and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherines drawingroom      490.31248967663737
 her ladyship received them civilly but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else and she was in fact almost engrossed by her nephews speaking to them especially to darcy much more than to any other person in the room      544.0385541613356
 colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them any thing was a welcome relief to him at rosings and mrs      365.26603291336863
 he now seated himself by her and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire of travelling and staying at home of new books and music that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before and they conversed with so much spirit and flow as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself as well as of mr      607.649113225947
 his eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling was more openly acknowledged for she did not scruple to call out what is that you are saying fitzwilliam      636.4092253191809
 what is it you are talking of      368.4191768864797
 what are you telling miss bennet      499.1041075342648
 let me hear what it is      1832.2815889285312
 we are speaking of music madam said he when no longer able to avoid a reply      873.6077534209089
 of music      40.11910197869102
 then pray speak aloud      1729.4435253892393
 it is of all subjects my delight      441.5265848586887
 i must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music      731.9677187897967
 if i had ever learnt i should have been a great proficient      151.4820165046235
 and so would anne if her health had allowed her to apply      158.83376830846416
 i am confident that she would have performed delightfully      203.95776567692843
 how does georgiana get on darcy      132.77524072035618
 darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sisters proficiency      498.69602215433775
 i assure you madam he replied that she does not need such advice      303.1927770483532
 she practises very constantly      2445.8024889638004
 so much the better      341.5977821990359
 i have told miss bennet several times that she will never play really well unless she practises more and though mrs      623.5721258476946
 collins has no instrument she is very welcome as i have often told her to come to rosings every day and play on the pianoforte in mrs      415.12961894449
 jenkinsons room      40.11910197869102
 she would be in nobodys way you know in that part of the house      667.799323868955
 darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunts ill breeding and made no answer      109.94802032047993
 when coffee was over colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him and she sat down directly to the instrument      1226.9539663287444
 he drew a chair near her      149.03516866374105
 lady catherine listened to half a song and then talked as before to her other nephew till the latter walked away from her and moving with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performers countenance      309.31539162117394
 elizabeth saw what he was doing and at the first convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile and said you mean to frighten me mr      1048.6174844291668
 darcy by coming in all this state to hear me      164.55909805999227
 there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others      1426.185425388802
 my courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me      164.55909805999227
 i shall not say that you are mistaken he replied because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own      523.5788286833031
 elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself and said to colonel fitzwilliam your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me and teach you not to believe a word i say      339.25128908794716
 i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character in a part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit      273.1763350359036
 darcy it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshireand give me leave to say very impolitic toofor it is provoking me to retaliate and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear      273.4581200832998
 i am not afraid of you said he smilingly      246.49196487810062
 you shall hear thenbut prepare yourself for something very dreadful      102.00034256777222
 the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire you must know was at a balland at this ball what do you think he did      1324.6493827264776
 he danced only four dances      193.76542062357612
 i am sorry to pain youbut so it was      287.54003505248056
 he danced only four dances though gentlemen were scarce and to my certain knowledge more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner      257.91355369711755
 darcy you cannot deny the fact      113.50930596523533
 i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party      210.95471501228246
 true and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room      169.00633687602323
 well colonel fitzwilliam what do i play next      522.285391316768
 my fingers wait your orders      678.2774000062835
 perhaps said darcy i should have judged better had i sought an introduction but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers      487.4630001228462
 shall we ask your cousin the reason of this      602.6961609906509
 said elizabeth still addressing colonel fitzwilliam      207.22126484587707
 shall we ask him why a man of sense and education and who has lived in the world is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers      378.92682324964085
 i can answer your question said fitzwilliam without applying to him      332.8015604100781
 it is because he will not give himself the trouble      1795.6574900935111
 i certainly have not the talent which some people possess said darcy of conversing easily with those i have never seen before      227.2738255947961
 i cannot catch their tone of conversation or appear interested in their concerns as i often see done      370.6095087459769
 my fingers said elizabeth do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many womens do      420.5905456931484
 they have not the same force or rapidity and do not produce the same expression      314.2224624367243
 but then i have always supposed it to be my own faultbecause i would not take the trouble of practising      425.1761794766115
 it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other womans of superior execution      322.7532511049352
 darcy smiled and said you are perfectly right      234.1879646505818
 you have employed your time much better      42.79635557662758
 no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think any thing wanting      377.77106351669687
 we neither of us perform to strangers      1123.2008772230677
 here they were interrupted by lady catherine who called out to know what they were talking of      968.5645284043917
 lady catherine approached and after listening for a few minutes said to darcy miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more and could have the advantage of a london master      375.67115925310736
 she has a very good notion of fingering though her taste is not equal to annes      344.6413693781092
 anne would have been a delightful performer had her health allowed her to learn      128.26207313864384
 elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousins praise but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley that he might have been just as likely to marry her had she been his relation      455.3211755856398
 lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeths performance mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste      332.0731590916661
 elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyships carriage was ready to take them all home      1008.9325114009478
 chapter ix      620.1082954481221
 elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning and writing to jane while mrs      1228.711976284636
 collins and maria were gone on business into the village when she was startled by a ring at the door the certain signal of a visitor      255.92717264808994
 as she had heard no carriage she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine and under that apprehension was putting away her halffinished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions when the door opened and to her very great surprise mr      268.68013791696956
 darcy only entered the room      139.75505364770575
 he seemed astonished too on finding her alone and apologised for his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within      1067.4364522347173
 they then sat down and when her enquiries after rosings were made seemed in danger of sinking into total silence      591.0960074654549
 it was absolutely necessary therefore to think of something and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure she observed how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november mr      869.6093607975303
 it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr      919.8092890604498
 he and his sisters were well i hope when you left london      175.73632566154058
 perfectly soi thank you      2056.6665453882724
 she found that she was to receive no other answerand after a short pause added i think i have understood that mr      668.9714865567391
 bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again      183.44241981096062
 he has many friends and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing      338.16940349282305
 if he means to be but little at netherfield it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then we might possibly get a settled family there      973.3595936369911
 but perhaps mr      553.6385512922801
 bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle      372.2214458823162
 i should not be surprised said darcy if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers      403.16555634576684
 elizabeth made no answer      317.1260553314424
 she was afraid of talking longer of his friend and having nothing else to say was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him      296.40161231436605
 he took the hint and soon began with this seems a very comfortable house      344.6535336432692
 lady catherine i believe did a great deal to it when mr      252.17216039676012
 collins first came to hunsford      119.94930567577303
 i believe she didand i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object      556.0273818422789
 collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife      180.0853392645635
 my friend has an excellent understandingthough i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr      302.3610327174085
 collins as the wisest thing she ever did      227.1604716445184
 she seems perfectly happy however and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her      7641.598278007023
 it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends      828.5044274340943
 an easy distance do you call it      473.3702891348853
 it is nearly fifty miles      202.60430451798896
 and what is fifty miles of good road      114.60547728798599
 little more than half a days journey      1035.5743332476811
 yes i call it a very easy distance      662.8491157908262
 i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match cried elizabeth      172.90833909256446
 i should never have said mrs      182.44256433244362
 it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire      510.0615533447413
 as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she understood he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield and she blushed as she answered i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family      859.2270117602937
 the far and the near must be relative and depend on many varying circumstances      342.6599083831966
 where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant distance becomes no evil      1493.156517703561
 but that is not the case here      961.3828248384349
 collins have a comfortable income but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeysand i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance      510.41043253567295
 darcy drew his chair a little towards her and said you cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment      235.23145760524807
 you cannot have been always at longbourn      93.57380990009219
 elizabeth looked surprised      553.6385512922801
 a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued on either side calm and conciseand soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister just returned from their walk      394.2827415022823
 the têteàtête surprised them      1729.4435253892393
 what can be the meaning of this      761.2599170904274
 said charlotte as soon as he was gone      272.5477652950914
 my dear eliza he must be in love with you or he would never have called on us in this familiar way      539.3297478260495
 all field sports were over      46.74347398462845
 within doors there was lady catherine books and a billiard table but gentlemen cannot be always within doors and in the nearness of the parsonage or the pleasantness of the walk to it or of the people who lived in it the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day      345.79311211073804
 they called at various times of the morning sometimes separately sometimes together and now and then accompanied by their aunt      271.9300003175846
 it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society a persuasion which of course recommended him still more and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him as well as by his evident admiration of her of her former favourite george wickham and though in comparing them she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliams manners she believed he might have the best informed mind      653.6941428174399
 but why mr      553.6385512922801
 darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult to understand      644.8090831182845
 it could not be for society as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips and when he did speak it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choicea sacrifice to propriety not a pleasure to himself      604.3850469435039
 collins knew not what to make of him      227.1604716445184
 colonel fitzwilliams occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was generally different which her own knowledge of him could not have told her and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love and the object of that love her friend eliza she sat herself seriously to work to find it out      311.20251419612737
she watched him whenever they were at rosings and whenever he came to hunsford but without much success      1155.7743912539777
 he certainly looked at her friend a great deal but the expression of that look was disputable      230.0473366432506
 it was an earnest steadfast gaze but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind      1199.3707126679071
 she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her but elizabeth always laughed at the idea and mrs      593.4971696597191
 collins did not think it right to press the subject from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt that all her friends dislike would vanish if she could suppose him to be in her power      436.21048369931333
 in her kind schemes for elizabeth she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam      79.64668084618408
 darcy had considerable patronage in the church and his cousin could have none at all      155.83694985555644
 chapter x      620.1082954481221
 more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park unexpectedly meet mr      322.2576087605782
she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought and to prevent its ever happening again took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers      1993.8258255516655
how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd      255.33859314395278
yet it did and even a third      1035.5743332476811
 it seemed like wilful illnature or a voluntary penance for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her      336.7559021424918
 he never said a great deal nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questionsabout her pleasure in being at hunsford her love of solitary walks and her opinion of mr      382.83754681164936
 collinss happiness and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too      513.514599667967
 his words seemed to imply it      603.7985448863138
 could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts      79.54818731699977
 she supposed if he meant any thing he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter      1761.2108137803068
 she was engaged one day as she walked in reperusing janes last letter and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits when instead of being again surprised by mr      552.9671145428849
 darcy she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her      511.8980898161226
 putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile she said i did not know before that you ever walked this way      913.3354580719442
 i have been making the tour of the park he replied as i generally do every year and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage      396.94545288125624
 are you going much farther      225.75951233528167
 no i should have turned in a moment      124.93451255912733
 and accordingly she did turn and they walked towards the parsonage together      117.3157340237423
 do you certainly leave kent on saturday      40.11910197869101
 said she      2056.6665453882724
 yesif darcy does not put it off again      731.5053662149488
 but i am at his disposal      526.8709402963223
 he arranges the business just as he pleases      124.97815918834128
 and if not able to please himself in the arrangement he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice      363.74707474838857
 i do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr      130.04216017330577
 he likes to have his own way very well replied colonel fitzwilliam      578.1748452356308
 but so we all do      814.6955581649441
 it is only that he has better means of having it than many others because he is rich and many others are poor      329.4268397225464
 i speak feelingly      47.71804916323267
 a younger son you know must be inured to selfdenial and dependence      158.83376830846416
 in my opinion the younger son of an earl can know very little of either      127.20381530917872
 now seriously what have you ever known of selfdenial and dependence      360.18137358366636
 when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring any thing you had a fancy for      622.4809489542303
 these are home questionsand perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature      1073.8725929348695
 but in matters of greater weight i may suffer from the want of money      1107.2468538585854
 younger sons cannot marry where they like      123.55749986770849
 unless where they like women of fortune which i think they very often do      1231.4224641035282
 our habits of expence make us too dependant and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money      1050.7122551761393
 and she coloured at the idea but recovering herself said in a lively tone and pray what is the usual price of an earls younger son      319.540721176685
 unless the elder brother is very sickly i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds      1069.3992643709205
 he answered her in the same style and the subject dropped      1541.325808373988
 to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed she soon afterwards said i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal      652.2371874450745
 i wonder he does not marry to secure a lasting convenience of that kind      214.1748064606586
 but perhaps his sister does as well for the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what he likes with her      1268.8770409036654
 no said colonel fitzwilliam that is an advantage which he must divide with me      119.90354294428913
 i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy      197.86056666635344
 are you indeed      51.75681083503038
 does your charge give you much trouble      420.13736348096677
 she directly replied you need not be frightened      334.29939977041204
 i never heard any harm of her and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world      133.40998989790293
 she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance mrs      555.6060365097507
 hurst and miss bingley      40.11910197869102
 i think i have heard you say that you know them      88.81671734506422
 i know them a little      44.519480662564156
 their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike manhe is a great friend of darcys      775.6460883677179
 yes said elizabeth drilymr      2056.6665453882724
 bingley and takes a prodigious deal of care of him      213.55740123710183
yes i really believe darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care      636.0580527585622
 but i ought to beg his pardon for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant      393.89823402636495
 it was all conjecture      275.1051068147718
 what is it you mean      826.340678089009
 it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be generally known because if it were to get round to the ladys family it would be an unpleasant thing      592.8516852921177
 you may depend upon my not mentioning it      118.1096785846048
 and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley      1237.6801428119936
 what he told me was merely this that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage but without mentioning names or any other particulars and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer      578.7435238757747
 did mr      40.11910197869102
 darcy give you his reasons for this interference      87.52082483823872
 i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady      299.9786958703121
 and what arts did he use to separate them      234.48582746820404
 he only told me what i have now told you      180.78953006080303
 elizabeth made no answer and walked on her heart swelling with indignation      1120.9757460543428
 after watching her a little fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful      1102.9958633364542
 i am thinking of what you have been telling me said she      168.98475995467072
 your cousins conduct does not suit my feelings      79.54818731699979
 why was he to be the judge      332.9921798442051
 you are rather disposed to call his interference officious      104.7566684648142
 i do not see what right mr      43.215159672798116
 darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friends inclination or why upon his own judgment alone he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy      303.0942677176133
 but she continued recollecting herself as we know none of the particulars it is not fair to condemn him      637.4612599026275
 it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case      371.25101893105585
 that is not an unnatural surmise said fitzwilliam but it is lessening the honour of my cousins triumph very sadly      204.86951685480304
 this was spoken jestingly but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr      1804.822906826107
 there shut into her own room as soon as their visitor left them she could think without interruption of all that she had heard      518.8167737600431
 it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected      931.0875409512485
 darcy could have such boundless influence      113.50930596523533
 that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate mr      290.66586332598405
 bingley and jane she had never doubted but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them      272.058640896367
 he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate generous heart in the world and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted      226.46936378371024
 to jane herself she exclaimed there could be no possibility of objection      288.95205448290636
 her understanding excellent her mind improved and her manners captivating      193.76542062357612
 neither could any thing be urged against my father who though with some peculiarities has abilities which mr      208.77582535672926
 darcy himself need not disdain and respectability which he will probably never reach      438.0298151845683
 when she thought of her mother indeed her confidence gave way a little but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with mr      495.49585683961834
 darcy whose pride she was convinced would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friends connections than from their want of sense and she was quite decided at last that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride and partly by the wish of retaining mr      522.0520017564969
 bingley for his sister      327.15695039771015
 the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a headache and it grew so much worse towards the evening that added to her unwillingness to see mr      453.24578421587023
 darcy it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings where they were engaged to drink tea      495.986596393276
 collins seeing that she was really unwell did not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her but mr      810.3745037269186
 collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherines being rather displeased by her staying at home      130.40647407060217
 chapter xi      620.1082954481221
 when they were gone elizabeth as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr      908.4672878108306
 darcy chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent      392.40778532496796
 they contained no actual complaint nor was there any revival of past occurrences or any communication of present suffering      279.3285203228075
 but in all and in almost every line of each there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style and which proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly disposed towards every one had been scarcely ever clouded      318.94830940669505
 elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal      733.0465997305247
 darcys shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a keener sense of her sisters sufferings      792.9900239844854
 it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits by all that affection could do      503.74666104787815
 she could not think of darcys leaving kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all and agreeable as he was she did not mean to be unhappy about him      281.7455997411273
 while settling this point she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself who had once before called late in the evening and might now come to enquire particularly after her      766.9394243391962
 but this idea was soon banished and her spirits were very differently affected when to her utter amazement she saw mr      910.3189093870493
 darcy walk into the room      139.75505364770575
 she answered him with cold civility      670.0843949619172
 he sat down for a few moments and then getting up walked about the room      499.6695886763083
 my feelings will not be repressed      1572.7832777610324
 you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love you      228.9979318873455
 elizabeths astonishment was beyond expression      215.01817017506332
 she stared coloured doubted and was silent      3984.9889653409305
 this he considered sufficient encouragement and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately followed      780.4292523823648
 he spoke well but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride      1671.3360919397542
 his sense of her inferiorityof its being a degradationof the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding but was very unlikely to recommend his suit      662.7339617489574
 in spite of her deeplyrooted dislike she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a mans affection and though her intentions did not vary for an instant she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive till roused to resentment by his subsequent language she lost all compassion in anger      588.124577205153
 she tried however to compose herself to answer him with patience when he should have done      760.3630267671148
 he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand      609.9431351243653
 as he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer      513.058976796346
 he spoke of apprehension and anxiety but his countenance expressed real security      988.6292060811485
 such a circumstance could only exasperate farther and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks and she said in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however unequally they may be returned      729.8748772603803
 it is natural that obligation should be felt and if i could feel gratitude i would now thank you      340.3358090184764
 but i cannoti have never desired your good opinion and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly      233.85984212319937
 i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one      236.13676515832307
 it has been most unconsciously done however and i hope will be of short duration      1019.5086243605666
 the feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation      475.3365002309233
 he was struggling for the appearance of composure and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it      338.50216721862165
 the pause was to elizabeths feelings dreadful      1132.2862363621482
 at length in a voice of forced calmness he said and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting      237.13292061725758
 i might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little endeavour at civility i am thus rejected      912.0699867729751
 but it is of small importance      526.8709402963223
 i might as well enquire replied she why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will against your reason and even against your character      627.8023671696589
 was not this some excuse for incivility if i was uncivil      664.1813722340471
 but i have other provocations      814.6955581649441
 you know i have      40.11910197869102
 as she pronounced these words mr      792.2783853415413
 i have every reason in the world to think ill of you      319.7013638092552
 no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there      446.8797095396954
 you dare not you cannot deny that you have been the principal if not the only means of dividing them from each other of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability the other to its derision for disappointed hopes and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind      293.3215321551655
 he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity      343.539201351096
 can you deny that you have done it      87.52082483823872
 she repeated      2056.6665453882724
 with assumed tranquillity he then replied i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister or that i rejoice in my success      527.9591536374385
 towards him i have been kinder than towards myself      558.0211346538733
 elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection but its meaning did not escape nor was it likely to conciliate her      547.9187242363909
 but it is not merely this affair she continued on which my dislike is founded      541.0302918812145
 long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided      484.14875923896255
 your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr      251.52247449511862
 on this subject what can you have to say      244.55606762089144
 in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself      356.8630269314319
 or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others      88.16855828435222
 you take an eager interest in that gentlemans concerns said darcy in a less tranquil tone and with a heightened colour      198.85763976645563
 who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in him      484.25589808718274
 his misfortunes      40.11910197869102
 repeated darcy contemptuously yes his misfortunes have been great indeed      2071.3132129778046
 and of your infliction cried elizabeth with energy      96.58601256237245
 you have reduced him to his present state of poverty comparative poverty      158.83376830846416
 you have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him      192.4546899973741
 you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert      269.01526535915565
 you have done all this      40.119101978691035
 and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule      183.6302501509263
 and this cried darcy as he walked with quick steps across the room is your opinion of me      229.018121959748
 this is the estimation in which you hold me      671.26667243744
 but perhaps added he stopping in his walk and turning towards her these offences might have been overlooked had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design      689.7184361308719
 these bitter accusations might have been suppressed had i with greater policy concealed my struggles and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified unalloyed inclination by reason by reflection by every thing      1244.7800079050141
 but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence      752.1964302304341
 nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related      109.46654312867302
 to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own      469.97159497093224
 elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said you are mistaken mr      1154.3600695985829
 darcy if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner      607.37363657164
 again his astonishment was obvious and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification      297.1431545711439
 she went on      697.5408648064462
 from the very beginning from the first moment i may almost say of my acquaintance with you your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance your conceit and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others were such as to form that groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry      612.2561659680066
 you have said quite enough madam      40.11910197869101
 i perfectly comprehend your feelings and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been      1427.0962862397964
 forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness      244.51457652179133
 and with these words he hastily left the room and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house      765.3645685965874
 the tumult of her mind was now painfully great      1138.3849417824417
 she knew not how to support herself and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour      654.157200823785
 her astonishment as she reflected on what had passed was increased by every review of it      869.7417089422768
 that she should receive an offer of marriage from mr      942.5040812538138
 that he should have been in love with her for so many months      454.898293933996
 so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friends marrying her sister and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case was almost incredible      319.7636351061632
 it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection      377.72569005520955
 she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catherines carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlottes observation and hurried her away to her room      304.36222060067325
 chapter xii      620.1082954481221
 elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes      855.9752196133527
 she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened it was impossible to think of any thing else and totally indisposed for employment she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise      605.4624968362459
 she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk when the recollection of mr      1413.2392636074812
 darcys sometimes coming there stopped her and instead of entering the park she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road      1202.5713636360763
 the park paling was still the boundary on one side and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground      420.9406683564122
 the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had made a great difference in the country and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees      849.7337159792208
 darcy she was directly retreating      139.75505364770575
 but the person who advanced was now near enough to see her and stepping forward with eagerness pronounced her name      873.1690792873802
 she had turned away but on hearing herself called though in a voice which proved it to be mr      340.93898388590384
 darcy she moved again towards the gate      97.83758319273011
 he had by that time reached it also and holding out a letter which she instinctively took said with a look of haughty composure i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you      456.89802686602553
 will you do me the honour of reading that letter      86.65830354848481
 with no expectation of pleasure but with the strongest curiosity elizabeth opened the letter and to her still increasing wonder perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper written quite through in a very close hand      1046.6127681515443
the envelope itself was likewise full      1832.2815889285312
pursuing her way along the lane she then began it      218.76544189060928
 it was dated from rosings at eight oclock in the morning and was as follows be not alarmed madam on receiving this letter by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you      453.6651810884553
 i write without any intention of paining you or humbling myself by dwelling on wishes which for the happiness of both cannot be too soon forgotten and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion should have been spared had not my character required it to be written and read      253.84020213495356
 you must therefore pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention your feelings i know will bestow it unwillingly but i demand it of your justice      522.9738661923016
 two offences of a very different nature and by no means of equal magnitude you last night laid to my charge      1212.7431051037197
 the first mentioned was that regardless of the sentiments of either i had detached mr      2267.160978684785
wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth the acknowledged favourite of my father a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage and who had been brought up to expect its exertion would be a depravity to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks could bear no comparison      308.12681382202777
but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed respecting each circumstance i shall hope to be in future secured when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read      1202.8167043819526
the necessity must be obeyedand farther apology would be absurd      7815.372589384656
i had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common with others that bingley preferred your eldest sister to any other young woman in the country      275.28743724329985
but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment      813.025327143703
at that ball while i had the honour of dancing with you i was first made acquainted by sir william lucass accidental information that bingleys attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage      240.77138135352996
 he spoke of it as a certain event of which the time alone could be undecided      718.0418220200074
 from that moment i observed my friends behaviour attentively and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him      983.4255064333685
 your sister i also watched      40.119101978691035
her look and manners were open cheerful and engaging as ever but without any symptom of peculiar regard and i remained convinced from the evenings scrutiny that though she received his attentions with pleasure she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment      395.15494830156797
 your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable      365.883365272306
if it be so if i have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her your resentment has not been unreasonable      610.5731524573249
 but i shall not scruple to assert that the serenity of your sisters countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that however amiable her temper her heart was not likely to be easily touched      774.1992274938879
that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certainbut i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears      836.7831577518117
i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished iti believed it on impartial conviction as truly as i wished it in reason      366.3390681580328
my objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me      825.8554528344789
but there were other causes of repugnancecauses which though still existing and existing to an equal degree in both instances i had myself endeavoured to forget because they were not immediately before me      1586.444562353228
these causes must be stated though briefly      7891.6962894972185
the situation of your mothers family though objectionable was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformly betrayed by herself by your three younger sisters and occasionally even by your father      495.02426288195034
pardon me      2578.448298374886
it pains me to offend you      652.6466850931697
 but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations and your displeasure at this representation of them let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both      649.5882719617495
i will only say farther that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed and every inducement heightened which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection      399.15922876280183
he left netherfield for london on the day following as you i am certain remember with the design of soon returning      1300.120154148685
the part which i acted is now to be explained      1803.1828843205324
his sisters uneasiness had been equally excited with my own our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered and alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london      939.0818867425868
we accordingly wentand there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice      357.24680410532886
but however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving of your sisters indifference      827.2268320898481
 he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere if not with equal regard      729.0639856578445
to convince him therefore that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point      274.4955755848035
 to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire when that conviction had been given was scarcely the work of a moment      482.5506210423845
i cannot blame myself for having done thus much      188.8393376148847
 there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sisters being in town      632.8546156747452
 i knew it myself as it was known to miss bingley but her brother is even yet ignorant of it      912.8370029857367
perhaps this concealment this disguise was beneath me      2467.5942378739805
on this subject i have nothing more to say no other apology to offer      1076.872631183237
 if i have wounded your sisters feelings it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient i have not yet learnt to condemn them      433.47353873294315
with respect to that other more weighty accusation of having injured mr      5820.763088797484
 wickham i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family      196.25302385401105
 of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant but of the truth of what i shall relate i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity      330.7410569652282
 my father supported him at school and afterwards at cambridgemost important assistance as his own father always poor from the extravagance of his wife would have been unable to give him a gentlemans education      753.3234311121917
 my father was not only fond of this young mans society whose manners were always engaging he had also the highest opinion of him and hoping the church would be his profession intended to provide for him in it      332.253208394605
 as for myself it is many many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner      804.4372754249771
 the vicious propensitiesthe want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments which mr      1052.9938332221989
 darcy could not have      48.56388609578208
 here again i shall give you painto what degree you only can tell      162.59536658430525
 but whatever may be the sentiments which mr      683.9145616261229
 wickham has created a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character      564.4794719012315
 it adds even another motive      204.90236923837804
 my excellent father died about five years ago and his attachment to mr      2017.0795108985862
 wickham was to the last so steady that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow and if he took orders desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant      621.1228048242475
 there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds      1197.0441047273318
 his own father did not long survive mine and within half a year from these events mr      382.9253810933785
 wickham wrote to inform me that having finally resolved against taking orders he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage in lieu of the preferment by which he could not be benefited      510.85408679543093
 he had some intention he added of studying the law and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein      375.6537603705297
 i rather wished than believed him to be sincere but at any rate was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal      402.5737331281938
 i knew that mr      45.693014538637115
 wickham ought not to be a clergyman      281.15955978281505
 he resigned all claim to assistance in the church were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it and accepted in return three thousand pounds      466.203460482152
 all connection between us seemed now dissolved      97.83758319273011
 i thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley or admit his society in town      151.45343997719291
 in town i believe he chiefly lived but his studying the law was a mere pretence and being now free from all restraint his life was a life of idleness and dissipation      428.9478757056764
 for about three years i heard little of him but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him he applied to me again by letter for the presentation      471.7105830174769
 his circumstances he assured me and i had no difficulty in believing it were exceedingly bad      937.519707893728
 you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty or for resisting every repetition of it      94.80434884328355
 his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstancesand he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself      1110.19043890119
 after this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropt      1036.3296175766316
 how he lived i know not      132.77524072035618
 but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice      1137.2322834168494
 having said thus much i feel no doubt of your secrecy      109.16935937972546
 my sister who is more than ten years my junior was left to the guardianship of my mothers nephew colonel fitzwilliam and myself      942.3352242779282
 about a year ago she was taken from school and an establishment formed for her in london and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it to ramsgate and thither also went mr      473.9877359453678
 wickham undoubtedly by design for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs      557.722838216789
 younge in whose character we were most unhappily deceived and by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to georgiana whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement      665.6504711390019
 she was then but fifteen which must be her excuse and after stating her imprudence i am happy to add that i owed the knowledge of it to herself      1584.9750941542175
 i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement and then georgiana unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father acknowledged the whole to me      472.66752497073117
 you may imagine what i felt and how i acted      99.0121254843707
 regard for my sisters credit and feelings prevented any public exposure but i wrote to mr      272.4660999545088
 wickham who left the place immediately and mrs      613.2510446116415
 younge was of course removed from her charge      107.35057460168989
 wickhams chief object was unquestionably my sisters fortune which is thirty thousand pounds but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement      965.8413933514069
 this madam is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together and if you do not absolutely reject it as false you will i hope acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mr      362.99557705593645
 i know not in what manner under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at      244.95947177330547
 ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either detection could not be in your power and suspicion certainly not in your inclination      165.87300359699287
 you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night      506.08867042416216
 but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed      820.3990358233166
 for the truth of every thing here related i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam who from our near relationship and constant intimacy and still more as one of the executors of my fathers will has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions      391.2413628816099
 if your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin and that there may be the possibility of consulting him i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning      499.5034005270338
 i will only add god bless you      129.8478204801193
 fitzwilliam darcy      919.7692405075667
 chapter xiii      620.1082954481221
 if elizabeth when mr      218.78303878412083
 darcy gave her the letter did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers she had formed no expectation at all of its contents      546.7725695833201
 but such as they were it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them and what a contrariety of emotion they excited      984.5783013986471
 her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined      828.8846555502254
 with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say she began his account of what had happened at netherfield      423.67025993597656
 she read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes      575.3913433993516
 his belief of her sisters insensibility she instantly resolved to be false and his account of the real the worst objections to the match made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice      1453.2013694628297
 he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her his style was not penitent but haughty      1697.264257691596
 it was all pride and insolence      516.7497138521829
 but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr      1190.220092811302
 wickham when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which if true must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition      979.8487031299868
 astonishment apprehension and even horror oppressed her      449.1080070953926
 she wished to discredit it entirely repeatedly exclaiming this must be false      1180.629976455782
 this cannot be      439.4232093657577
and when she had gone through the whole letter though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two put it hastily away protesting that she would not regard it that she would never look in it again      297.879048822233
 in this perturbed state of mind with thoughts that could rest on nothing she walked on but it would not do in half a minute the letter was unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she could she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence      741.0999492004674
 the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself and the kindness of the late mr      434.2382547617895
 darcy though she had not before known its extent agreed equally well with his own words      158.55665413359412
 so far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to the will the difference was great      673.1175171865455
 what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory and as she recalled his very words it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other and for a few moments she flattered herself that her wishes did not err      359.586008629768
 but when she read and reread with the closest attention the particulars immediately following of wickhams resigning all pretensions to the living of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds again was she forced to hesitate      557.2540599448297
 she put down the letter weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartialitydeliberated on the probability of each statementbut with little success      1319.7990995492437
 on both sides it was only assertion      344.6535336432692
 again she read on      54.37643156657262
 but every line proved more clearly that the affair which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render mr      495.02815019630424
 darcys conduct in it less than infamous was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole      284.8442675484856
 the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to mr      770.249568672387
 wickhams charge exceedingly shocked her the more so as she could bring no proof of its injustice      549.6621769098497
 she had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire militia in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who on meeting him accidentally in town had there renewed a slight acquaintance      482.75526534584054
 as to his real character had information been in her power she had never felt a wish of enquiring      332.23725725886345
 darcy or at least by the predominance of virtue atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what mr      412.98751685205366
 darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance      71.91929341677493
 but no such recollection befriended her      493.23587565936685
 she could see him instantly before her in every charm of air and address but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess      652.2585384026168
 after pausing on this point a considerable while she once more continued to read      689.0789658005602
 but alas      2056.6665453882724
 the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himselffrom whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousins affairs and whose character she had no reason to question      625.3087581802246
 at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr      839.2355557880885
 darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal if he had not been well assured of his cousins corroboration      186.24483555485497
 she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself in their first evening at mr      3699.2040281488194
 philipss      40.11910197869102
 many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory      178.05909693569475
 she was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger and wondered it had escaped her before      862.4306033781992
 she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct      800.116024294944
 she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing mr      5381.361833511334
 darcy might leave the country but that he should stand his ground yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week      408.634053616337
 she remembered also that till the netherfield family had quitted the country he had told his story to no one but herself but that after their removal it had been every where discussed that he had then no reserves no scruples in sinking mr      1401.7560159554182
 darcys character though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son      543.6711245283307
 how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned      804.353839451412
 his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes but his eagerness to grasp at any thing      821.0929633003209
 his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn      291.1795600868643
 every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter and in farther justification of mr      187.40460669399442
 bingley when questioned by jane had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair that proud and repulsive as were his manners she had never in the whole course of their acquaintance an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjustany thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits      638.1447230441612
 that among his own connections he was esteemed and valuedthat even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling      667.1989675959849
 bingley was incomprehensible      631.7212696375212
 she grew absolutely ashamed of herself      621.4382623065666
of neither darcy nor wickham could she think without feeling that she had been blind partial prejudiced absurd      295.6839348952056
 how despicably have i acted      168.68259607116462
 she cried      2056.6665453882724
i who have prided myself on my discernment      111.1664056375724
i who have valued myself on my abilities      111.1664056375724
 who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable distrust      440.67438725780835
how humiliating is this discovery      168.68259607116462
yet how just a humiliation      814.6955581649441
had i been in love i could not have been more wretchedly blind      283.65518783187775
 but vanity not love has been my folly      289.8076920581833
pleased with the preference of one and offended by the neglect of the other on the very beginning of our acquaintance i have courted prepossession and ignorance and driven reason away where either were concerned      1560.822583645199
 till this moment i never knew myself      336.2508332279449
 from herself to janefrom jane to bingley her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that mr      716.637258758063
 darcys explanation there had appeared very insufficient and she read it again      900.3102289937426
 widely different was the effect of a second perusal      226.428278746604
how could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance which she had been obliged to give in the other      304.7080063268502
neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane      556.3625093452954
she felt that janes feelings though fervent were little displayed and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner not often united with great sensibility      1452.5518035201321
 the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as having passed at the netherfield ball and as confirming all his first disapprobation could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers      650.150988633395
 the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt      1509.8076293731594
 after wandering along the lane for two hours giving way to every variety of thought reconsidering events determining probabilities and reconciling herself as well as she could to a change so sudden and so important fatigue and a recollection of her long absence made her at length return home and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation      276.07890103357823
 she was immediately told that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence mr      1897.6464226019004
elizabeth could but just affect concern in missing him she really rejoiced at it      586.9547126298779
 colonel fitzwilliam was no longer an object      270.1572563497871
 she could think only of her letter      918.626206661495
 chapter xiv      620.1082954481221
 the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning and mr      760.1378338263869
 collins having been in waiting near the lodges to make them his parting obeisance was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very good health and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings      298.2442284136018
 to rosings he then hastened to console lady catherine and her daughter and on his return brought back with great satisfaction a message from her ladyship importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her      471.5356478098363
 elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting that had she chosen it she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece nor could she think without a smile of what her ladyships indignation would have been      513.6792051299971
 what would she have said      826.340678089009
how would she have behaved      709.2336770753424
 their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party      375.35110414652706
 but i am particularly attached to these young men and know them to be so much attached to me      463.2250179335115
they were excessively sorry to go      1632.3773188485725
 but so they always are      814.6955581649441
 the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely more i think than last year      254.65492102422263
 his attachment to rosings certainly increases      196.7241522629276
 collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter      241.68746046286134
 lady catherine observed after dinner that miss bennet seemed out of spirits and immediately accounting for it herself by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon she added but if that is the case you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer      845.2087018918355
 collins will be very glad of your company i am sure      300.24531239854605
 i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation replied elizabeth but it is not in my power to accept it      295.8973557566033
i must be in town next saturday      1262.3792521726189
 why at that rate you will have been here only six weeks      499.1041075342648
 i expected you to stay two months      3323.1318856411367
 but my father cannot      1729.4435253892393
he wrote last week to hurry my return      1729.4435253892393
 your father of course may spare you if your mother can      298.7000490284855
daughters are never of so much consequence to a father      459.6462305827048
 and if you will stay another month complete it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london for i am going there early in june for a week and as dawson does not object to the barouche box there will be very good room for one of youand indeed if the weather should happen to be cool i should not object to taking you both as you are neither of you large      471.89254445903856
 lady catherine seemed resigned      48.56388609578208
 you know i always speak my mind and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves      288.34605621836334
 you must contrive to send somebody      149.03516866374105
 i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing      258.37494093934606
 when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer i made a point of her having two men servants go with her      456.94752600336903
miss darcy the daughter of mr      2826.0051835090194
i am excessively attentive to all those things      1559.84002276715
 you must send john with the young ladies mrs      553.6385512922801
 my uncle is to send a servant for us      424.1466343773184
your uncle      40.11910197869102
he keeps a manservant does he      2056.6665453882715
i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things      165.87300359699287
 where shall you change horses      814.6955581649441
 bromley of course      553.6385512922801
 reflection must be reserved for solitary hours whenever she was alone she gave way to it as the greatest relief and not a day went by without a solitary walk in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections      887.296426108291
 darcys letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart      1270.2914874517355
 she studied every sentence and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different      1014.6968435375434
 when she remembered the style of his address she was still full of indignation but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him her anger was turned against herself and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion      1262.4320991066502
 his attachment excited gratitude his general character respect but she could not approve him nor could she for a moment repent her refusal or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again      1216.902729599227
 they were hopeless of remedy      814.6955581649441
 her father contented with laughing at them would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters and her mother with manners so far from right herself was entirely insensible of the evil      388.21731134651276
 elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia but while they were supported by their mothers indulgence what chance could there be of improvement      421.5632342247926
 catherine weakspirited irritable and completely under lydias guidance had been always affronted by their advice and lydia selfwilled and careless would scarcely give them a hearing      823.5258233559048
 they were ignorant idle and vain      493.23587565936685
 while there was an officer in meryton they would flirt with him and while meryton was within a walk of longbourn they would be going there for ever      755.0926416255561
 anxiety on janes behalf was another prevailing concern and mr      404.7697243444229
 darcys explanation by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion heightened the sense of what jane had lost      465.16041637226164
 his affection was proved to have been sincere and his conduct cleared of all blame unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend      774.0184436491312
 how grievous then was the thought that of a situation so desirable in every respect so replete with advantage so promising for happiness jane had been deprived by the folly and indecorum of her own family      521.0894138925489
 when to these recollections was added the developement of wickhams character it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful      968.4425006064268
 their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they had been at first      985.9649340548395
 the very last evening was spent there and her ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey gave them directions as to the best method of packing and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way that maria thought herself obliged on her return to undo all the work of the morning and pack her trunk afresh      492.011338136501
 when they parted lady catherine with great condescension wished them a good journey and invited them to come to hunsford again next year and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both      545.6082273632219
 chapter xv      620.1082954481221
 on saturday morning elizabeth and mr      180.38147919610512
 collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary      978.3949983014595
 i know not miss elizabeth said he whether mrs      94.40006465262863
 the favour of your company has been much felt i assure you      252.6843160233501
 we know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode      328.00509743628186
 elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness      992.8478108983953
 she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment and the pleasure of being with charlotte and the kind attentions she had received must make her feel the obliged      2109.201372154084
 collins was gratified and with a more smiling solemnity replied it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably      332.2378311076042
 we have certainly done our best and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society and from our connection with rosings the frequent means of varying the humble home scene i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome      606.7383917154428
 our situation with regard to lady catherines family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast      264.6248839910864
 you see on what a footing we are      838.1841865769043
 you see how continually we are engaged there      838.1841865769043
 in truth i must acknowledge that with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage i should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings      501.0641272109746
 words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings and he was obliged to walk about the room while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences      868.1628799880673
 i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so      726.814399383942
 lady catherines great attentions to mrs      45.567935788034156
 collins you have been a daily witness of and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunatebut on this point it will be as well to be silent      261.6419557933205
 only let me assure you my dear miss elizabeth that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage      469.48662269781124
 my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking      203.77451223483303
 there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us      593.4155389067906
 we seem to have been designed for each other      7640.142235482199
 elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts      496.6553434205674
 she was not sorry however to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung      508.7423123786237
 poor charlotte      2056.6665453882724
it was melancholy to leave her to such society      3401.558051144389
but she had chosen it with her eyes open and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go she did not seem to ask for compassion      688.7181461566679
 her home and her housekeeping her parish and her poultry and all their dependent concerns had not yet lost their charms      186.4278298478309
 at length the chaise arrived the trunks were fastened on the parcels placed within and it was pronounced to be ready      741.6043580278697
 after an affectionate parting between the friends elizabeth was attended to the carriage by mr      1087.0694934744597
 collins and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter and his compliments to mr      285.7629883042328
 gardiner though unknown      46.64598115839911
 he then handed her in maria followed and the door was on the point of being closed when he suddenly reminded them with some consternation that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings      251.9345261152599
 but he added you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here      219.67357083145652
 good gracious      40.11910197869102
and yet how many things have happened      384.4056154820648
 a great many indeed said her companion with a sigh      462.91962731452884
 we have dined nine times at rosings besides drinking tea there twice      301.7579050288608
how much i shall have to tell      753.5815562796035
 elizabeth privately added and how much i shall have to conceal      741.6482949915529
 gardiners house where they were to remain a few days      220.3233924074947
 jane looked well and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them      192.13758215639237
 but jane was to go home with her and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation      558.0211346538733
 it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for longbourn before she told her sister of mr      522.6729021481106
 darcys proposals      40.11910197869102
 to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane and must at the same time so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate and her fear if she once entered on the subject of being hurried into repeating something of bingley which might only grieve her sister farther      467.9073518007504
 chapter xvi      620.1082954481221
 bennets carriage was to meet them they quickly perceived in token of the coachmans punctuality both kitty and lydia looking out of a diningroom up stairs      1110.3668572780628
 these two girls had been above an hour in the place happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner watching the sentinel on guard and dressing a sallad and cucumber      833.1998380000581
 after welcoming their sisters they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords exclaiming is not this nice      997.3837755685561
 and we mean to treat you all added lydia but you must lend us the money for we have just spent ours at the shop out there      413.1638041886598
 i do not think it is very pretty but i thought i might as well buy it as not      135.3456583693207
 i shall pull it to pieces as soon as i get home and see if i can make it up any better      257.2160813284077
 and when her sisters abused it as ugly she added with perfect unconcern oh      217.9362218266427
 but there were two or three much uglier in the shop and when i have bought some prettiercoloured satin to trim it with fresh i think it will be very tolerable      1228.6672159193122
 besides it will not much signify what one wears this summer after the shire have left meryton and they are going in a fortnight      1001.1753058992188
 cried elizabeth with the greatest satisfaction      404.8802705831523
 they are going to be encamped near brighton and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer      341.95302828916977
 it would be such a delicious scheme and i dare say would hardly cost any thing at all      479.95722303721135
 mamma would like to go too of all things      1457.0723699235336
 yes thought elizabeth that would be a delightful scheme indeed and completely do for us at once      402.4477572282587
 brighton and a whole campful of soldiers to us who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia and the monthly balls of meryton      321.95279829087025
 what do you think      270.45643337730826
 it is excellent news capital news and about a certain person that we all like      1342.9959402065904
 jane and elizabeth looked at each other and the waiter was told that he need not stay      301.8730192038335
 lydia laughed and said aye that is just like your formality and discretion      86.0671008422106
 but he is an ugly fellow      493.23587565936685
 i am glad he is gone      184.61315922261164
 i never saw such a long chin in my life      448.57829369731706
 well but now for my news it is about dear wickham too good for the waiter is not it      601.0273447524385
 there is no danger of wickhams marrying mary king      1302.7089954291175
 theres for you      439.4232093657577
 wickham is safe      501.39750398664387
 and mary king is safe      46.74347398462845
 added elizabeth safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune      217.5960060437813
 but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side said jane      775.6460883677179
 i am sure there is not on his      367.8042227944267
 i will answer for it he never cared three straws about her      315.13128851206596
 who could about such a nasty little freckled thing      163.72306807567136
 elizabeth was shocked to think that however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal      578.5684321826815
 as soon as all had ate and the elder ones paid the carriage was ordered and after some contrivance the whole party with all their boxes workbags and parcels and the unwelcome addition of kittys and lydias purchases were seated in it      357.7187774346082
 how nicely we are crammed in      132.77524072035618
 i am glad i bought my bonnet if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox      110.99212611339226
 and in the first place let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away      347.7267683736354
 have you seen any pleasant men      169.27659545907346
 i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back      256.16904864228314
 jane will be quite an old maid soon i declare      205.56899392350272
 she is almost three and twenty      663.8157882572414
 my aunt philips wants you so to get husbands you cant think      298.6417904776259
 she says lizzy had better have taken mr      1005.6557168745067
 collins but i do not think there would have been any fun in it      342.31244073066705
 lord      40.11910197869102
 how i should like to be married before any of you and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls      170.59371839798033
 dear me      40.11910197869102
 we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel forsters      349.73018266425413
 forster promised to have a little dance in the evening by the bye mrs      1074.6248900936666
 forster and me are such friends      1572.7832777610324
 and so she asked the two harringtons to come but harriet was ill and so pen was forced to come by herself and then what do you think we did      459.64623058270456
 not a soul knew of it but col      289.80769205818336
 forster and kitty and me except my aunt for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns and you cannot imagine how well he looked      436.2374437663334
 lord      40.11910197869102
 how i laughed      40.11910197869101
 and so did mrs      48.563886095782074
 forster      40.11910197869102
 i thought i should have died      144.80475927254847
 and that made the men suspect something and then they soon found out what was the matter      411.68211583185735
 with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did lydia assisted by kittys hints and additions endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longbourn      432.2882044734923
 elizabeth listened as little as she could but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickhams name      1412.5614554029087
 their reception at home was most kind      371.25101893105585
 bennet rejoiced to see jane in undiminished beauty and more than once during dinner did mr      1070.6820777497055
 bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth i am glad you are come back lizzy      879.2625305176796
 their party in the diningroom was large for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news and various were the subjects which occupied them lady lucas was enquiring of maria across the table after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter mrs      261.2634757714108
 mary said she i wish you had gone with us for we had such fun      411.8143250364023
 as we went along kitty and me drew up all the blinds and pretended there was nobody in the coach and i should have gone so all the way if kitty had not been sick and when we got to the george i do think we behaved very handsomely for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world and if you would have gone we would have treated you too      609.3421790120769
 and then when we came away it was such fun      195.1453320693975
 i thought we never should have got into the coach      177.69275441557818
 i was ready to die of laughter      457.171266742887
 and then we were so merry all the way home      195.1453320693975
 we talked and laughed so loud that any body might have heard us ten miles off      289.8076920581833
 to this mary very gravely replied far be it from me my dear sister to depreciate such pleasures      369.4150163979521
 they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds      302.86115565944357
 but i confess they would have no charms for me      329.3032269689317
 but of this answer lydia heard not a word      951.9755811839477
 she seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute and never attended to mary at all      1848.2280381629087
 in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton and see how every body went on but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme      271.53757306582713
 there was another reason too for her opposition      1729.4435253892393
 she dreaded seeing wickham again and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible      1080.0949643969727
 the comfort to her of the regiments approaching removal was indeed beyond expression      1003.3523479374672
 in a fortnight they were to go and once gone she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account      393.9522709143209
 she had not been many hours at home before she found that the brighton scheme of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn was under frequent discussion between her parents      368.25138151595365
 elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal that her mother though often disheartened had never yet despaired of succeeding at last      760.3239961562168
 elizabeths impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned and preparing her to be surprised she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr      736.0218773255672
 miss bennets astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings      2607.97973644575
 she was sorry that mr      1074.9972338701825
 darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sisters refusal must have given him      230.74012628775972
 his being so sure of succeeding was wrong said she and certainly ought not to have appeared but consider how much it must increase his disappointment      750.4083006939659
 indeed replied elizabeth i am heartily sorry for him but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me      822.7050044338264
 you do not blame me however for refusing him      40.11910197869101
 blame you      2056.6665453882724
 oh no      40.11910197869102
 but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham      322.55957517257986
 but you will know it when i have told you what happened the very next day      166.3515534845974
 she then spoke of the letter repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham      1052.565787135935
 what a stroke was this for poor jane      292.3898369722014
 who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here collected in one individual      122.3517271747806
 most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error and seek to clear one without involving the other      673.1506148930914
 this will not do said elizabeth      603.7985448863138
 you never will be able to make both of them good for any thing      214.17480646065863
 there is but such a quantity of merit between them just enough to make one good sort of man and of late it has been shifting about pretty much      581.2106117998521
 for my part i am inclined to believe it all mr      318.1278256330685
 darcys but you shall do as you chuse      255.38378634859745
 it was some time however before a smile could be extorted from jane      1677.0687168816116
 i do not know when i have been more shocked said she      76.21966218932734
 wickham so very bad      1081.5754508315883
 it is almost past belief      202.60430451798896
 and poor mr      51.75681083503038
 dear lizzy only consider what he must have suffered      110.99212611339226
 such a disappointment      697.5408648064462
 and having to relate such a thing of his sister      49.240270405711485
 it is really too distressing      202.60430451798896
 i am sure you must feel it so      367.8042227944267
 no my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both      288.5251834914274
 i know you will do him such ample justice that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent      90.24295069091625
 poor wickham there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance      240.76181760189826
 there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men      980.3054242661333
 one has got all the goodness and the other all the appearance of it      236.51536099250367
 i never thought mr      45.693014538637115
 and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him without any reason      481.4240173496141
 it is such a spur to ones genius such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind      634.444787907171
 lizzy when you first read that letter i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now      181.9180191818255
 indeed i could not      45.693014538637115
 i was uncomfortable enough      275.1051068147718
 i was very uncomfortable i may say unhappy      337.277959410241
 and with no one to speak to of what i felt no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had      360.6151072495734
 how i wanted you      241.5461082312236
 how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of wickham to mr      342.2985579881013
 darcy for now they do appear wholly undeserved      191.5108225402103
 certainly      40.11910197869102
 but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging      1467.5500563813919
 there is one point on which i want your advice      985.8271866093645
 i want to be told whether i ought or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand wickhams character      566.0499389894343
 miss bennet paused a little and then replied surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully      2912.068380858883
 what is your own opinion      826.340678089009
 that it ought not to be attempted      368.4191768864797
 darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public      177.62610381894092
 darcy is so violent that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light      327.5661034792374
 i am not equal to it      184.61315922261164
 wickham will soon be gone and therefore it will not signify to anybody here what he really is      332.8240048639131
 sometime hence it will be all found out and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before      2218.3637486495372
 at present i will say nothing about it      2074.991148928952
 you are quite right      40.11910197869102
 to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever      175.1983600994689
 he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done and anxious to reestablish a character      499.32475601174576
 we must not make him desperate      1832.2815889285312
 the tumult of elizabeths mind was allayed by this conversation      814.6955581649441
 she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight and was certain of a willing listener in jane whenever she might wish to talk again of either      506.79886264250183
 but there was still something lurking behind of which prudence forbad the disclosure      1340.535204581212
 she dared not relate the other half of mr      650.9478582709577
 darcys letter nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend      664.5839569158818
 here was knowledge in which no one could partake and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery      304.2729608236828
 and then said she if that very improbable event should ever take place i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself      407.9268532848804
 the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value      627.7462821576177
 she was now on being settled at home at leisure to observe the real state of her sisters spirits      775.7577964196981
 jane was not happy      48.56388609578208
 she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley      1519.6478732850962
 having never even fancied herself in love before her regard had all the warmth of first attachment and from her age and disposition greater steadiness than first attachments often boast and so fervently did she value his remembrance and prefer him to every other man that all her good sense and all her attention to the feelings of her friends were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity      364.0241390344663
 well lizzy said mrs      1729.4435253892393
 bennet one day what is your opinion now of this sad business of janes      656.4046129538706
 for my part i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody      350.7036920478267
 i told my sister philips so the other day      226.42827874660398
 but i cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london      318.3050266354209
 well he is a very undeserving young manand i do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now      488.1768851713839
 there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer and i have enquired of every body too who is likely to know      415.67528407809795
 i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more      243.625952904845
 oh well      40.11910197869102
 it is just as he chooses      586.6595363047983
 nobody wants him to come      193.76542062357615
 well my comfort is i am sure jane will die of a broken heart and then he will be sorry for what he has done      608.2948460969606
 but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation she made no answer      1072.7886372696369
 well lizzy continued her mother soon afterwards and so the collinses live very comfortable do they      234.2428822178011
 and what sort of table do they keep      114.60547728798599
 charlotte is an excellent manager i dare say      214.75131045445613
 there is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping i dare say      985.8271866093645
 no nothing at all      40.11910197869102
 a great deal of good management depend upon it      253.2587015892548
 they will take care not to outrun their income      502.8532499251075
 they will never be distressed for money      961.3828248384349
 well much good may it do them      1061.4526955302235
 they look upon it quite as their own i dare say whenever that happens      206.36019223080186
 it was a subject which they could not mention before me      794.9980909179278
 no      40.11910197869102
 it would have been strange if they had      257.78007662665317
 but i make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves      581.6040686906538
 well if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own so much the better      587.8790045800816
 the first week of their return was soon gone      1089.391740455925
 the second began      439.4232093657577
 it was the last of the regiments stay in meryton and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace      1083.8836281761191
 the dejection was almost universal      814.6955581649441
 the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat drink and sleep and pursue the usual course of their employments      1806.511096333307
 very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia whose own misery was extreme and who could not comprehend such hardheartedness in any of the family      700.1756933120486
 what is to become of us      499.1041075342648
 how can you be smiling so lizzy      261.01648441462936
 their affectionate mother shared all their grief she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion five and twenty years ago      1345.6165903945157
 i am sure said she i cried for two days together when colonel millars regiment went away      513.058976796346
 i thought i should have broke my heart      105.05698375244035
 i am sure i shall break mine said lydia      287.54003505248056
 observed mrs      40.11910197869102
if one could but go to brighton      325.7009922284426
 but papa is so disagreeable      814.6955581649441
 a little seabathing would set me up for ever      547.4108018022345
 and my aunt philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good added kitty      174.35792592895586
 such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through longbournhouse      1618.1717506969835
 elizabeth tried to be diverted by them but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame      788.9905928883518
 she felt anew the justice of mr      3166.461889625423
 darcys objections and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend      502.0501805540102
 but the gloom of lydias prospect was shortly cleared away for she received an invitation from mrs      541.684769828479
 forster the wife of the colonel of the regiment to accompany her to brighton      1660.4781674970995
 this invaluable friend was a very young woman and very lately married      173.22420550304233
 a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other and out of their three months acquaintance they had been intimate two      385.23010546289316
 the rapture of lydia on this occasion her adoration of mrs      664.1813722340471
 forster the delight of mrs      678.2774000062835
 bennet and the mortification of kitty are scarcely to be described      707.380452269879
 wholly inattentive to her sisters feelings lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy calling for every ones congratulations and laughing and talking with more violence than ever whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish      626.6733550535263
 i cannot see why mrs      145.70499561848857
 i have just as much right to be asked as she has and more too for i am two years older      386.81023105367433
 in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable and jane to make her resigned      79.1859943307538
 as for elizabeth herself this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia that she considered it as the deathwarrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter and detestable as such a step must make her were it known she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go      759.740753844923
 she represented to him all the improprieties of lydias general behaviour the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs      1179.1560735995647
 forster and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton where the temptations must be greater than at home      676.0892390566964
 if you were aware said elizabeth of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of lydias unguarded and imprudent manner nay which has already arisen from it i am sure you would judge differently in the affair      578.6463717637217
 repeated mr      40.11910197869102
 what has she frightened away some of your lovers      562.4384103917047
 poor little lizzy      553.6385512922801
 but do not be cast down      493.23587565936685
 such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret      584.1631228513057
 come let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydias folly      4154.733954950936
 indeed you are mistaken      45.693014538637115
 i have no such injuries to resent      148.44344286524932
 it is not of peculiar but of general evils which i am now complaining      347.7309667424879
 excuse mefor i must speak plainly      4265.950258394138
 if you my dear father will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment      370.4382604768805
 a flirt too in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite      654.1428871635811
 she will follow wherever lydia leads      2056.6665453882715
 vain ignorant idle and absolutely uncontrouled      49.69641882427861
 my dear father can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace      582.0752188224973
 bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject and affectionately taking her hand said in reply do not make yourself uneasy my love      890.3985855996632
 wherever you and jane are known you must be respected and valued and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple ofor i may say three very silly sisters      231.04188114676646
 let her go then      1729.4435253892393
 colonel forster is a sensible man and will keep her out of any real mischief and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body      932.009165774748
 at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here      550.5158701359431
 let us hope therefore that her being there may teach her her own insignificance      1115.3284664447367
 at any rate she cannot grow many degrees worse without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life      342.9993169179992
 with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content but her own opinion continued the same and she left him disappointed and sorry      659.2558529120669
 it was not in her nature however to increase her vexations by dwelling on them      336.7982439955993
 she was confident of having performed her duty and to fret over unavoidable evils or augment them by anxiety was no part of her disposition      592.1486122476783
 had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility      153.92590232209076
 in lydias imagination a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness      169.93505120523494
 she saw with the creative eye of fancy the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers      1320.469020400184
 she saw all the glories of the camp its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines crowded with the young and the gay and dazzling with scarlet and to complete the view she saw herself seated beneath a tent tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once      1338.3622235257471
 had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these what would have been her sensations      288.95205448290636
 they could have been understood only by her mother who might have felt nearly the same      248.36859644056855
 lydias going to brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husbands never intending to go there himself      130.48639006702
 but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of lydias leaving home      971.493439860212
 elizabeth was now to see mr      175.26129507828713
 wickham for the last time      559.6489556452747
 having been frequently in company with him since her return agitation was pretty well over the agitations of former partiality entirely so      469.1543941510444
 she had even learnt to detect in the very gentleness which had first delighted her an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary      412.9078059568914
 in his present behaviour to herself moreover she had a fresh source of displeasure for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve after what had since passed to provoke her      725.7014241697827
 she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry and while she steadily repressed it could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing that however long and for whatever cause his attentions had been withdrawn her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal      554.3760772058512
 on the very last day of the regiments remaining in meryton he dined with others of the officers at longbourn and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford she mentioned colonel fitzwilliams and mr      488.0356766383511
 darcys having both spent three weeks at rosings and asked him if he were acquainted with the former      226.38109105994226
 he looked surprised displeased alarmed but with a moments recollection and a returning smile replied that he had formerly seen him often and after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man asked her how she had liked him      647.4667826432982
 her answer was warmly in his favour      137.80852986475443
 with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added how long did you say that he was at rosings      139.77566999550052
 and you saw him frequently      46.74347398462845
 yes almost every day      2056.6665453882724
 his manners are very different from his cousins      367.8042227944267
 yes very different      553.6385512922801
 but i think mr      1729.4435253892393
 darcy improves on acquaintance      48.56388609578208
 cried wickham with a look which did not escape her      599.8168989967564
 and pray may i ask      46.74347398462845
 has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style      338.7117961722403
 for i dare not hope he continued in a lower and more serious tone that he is improved in essentials      272.9918682935849
 oh no      40.11910197869102
 said elizabeth      2056.6665453882724
 in essentials i believe he is very much what he ever was      1280.302025096646
 while she spoke wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning      1296.3206059481718
 there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention while she added when i said that he improved on acquaintance i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement but that from knowing him better his disposition was better understood      563.689723893918
 darcy will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right      195.70953788947807
 his pride in that direction may be of service if not to himself to many others for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by      419.9372739260649
 i only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you i imagine have been alluding is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe      386.57969026517173
 his fear of her has always operated i know when they were together and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh which i am certain he has very much at heart      402.28846338705637
 elizabeth could not repress a smile at this but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head      289.7069839104904
 she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances and she was in no humour to indulge him      1076.58287787403
 the rest of the evening passed with the appearance on his side of usual cheerfulness but with no farther attempt to distinguish elizabeth and they parted at last with mutual civility and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again      1323.5094918375773
 when the party broke up lydia returned with mrs      1138.3849417824417
 forster to meryton from whence they were to set out early the next morning      1744.7584578363096
 the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic      2204.886320885765
 kitty was the only one who shed tears but she did weep from vexation and envy      731.3626852462
 bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible advice which there was every reason to believe would be attended to and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard      606.5473711629811
 had elizabeths opinion been all drawn from her own family she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort      411.63618938369893
 her father captivated by youth and beauty and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally give had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her      462.3404547898982
 respect esteem and confidence had vanished for ever and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown      9278.938691252752
 but mr      2056.6665453882724
 bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice      690.7885252648321
 he was fond of the country and of books and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments      464.8096670600669
 to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement      912.8370029857367
 this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife but where other powers of entertainment are wanting the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given      924.5012929019994
 elizabeth however had never been blind to the impropriety of her fathers behaviour as a husband      763.7428776483194
 she had always seen it with pain but respecting his abilities and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children was so highly reprehensible      746.9582894414581
 but she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so illjudged a direction of talents talents which rightly used might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife      596.8833364017884
 when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickhams departure she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment      440.16998506502205
 their parties abroad were less varied than before and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle and though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense since the disturbers of her brain were removed her other sister from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp      667.6377117787551
 upon the whole therefore she found what has been sometimes found before that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire did not in taking place bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself      684.0274055806963
 it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation console herself for the present and prepare for another disappointment      1096.949379182611
 her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable and could she have included jane in the scheme every part of it would have been perfect      606.4291045954286
 but it is fortunate thought she that i have something to wish for      752.37962109604
 but here by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sisters absence i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized      374.6163123369878
 a scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation      834.5232938918166
 when lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and kitty but her letters were always long expected and always very short      473.80028945044484
 those to her mother contained little else than that they were just returned from the library where such and such officers had attended them and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild that she had a new gown or a new parasol which she would have described more fully but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry as mrs      823.3424002638712
 forster called her and they were going to the campand from her correspondence with her sister there was still less to be learntfor her letters to kitty though rather longer were much too full of lines under the words to be made public      394.8265078901435
 after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence health good humour and cheerfulness began to reappear at longbourn      1084.2421405224707
 everything wore a happier aspect      935.8394474874626
 the families who had been in town for the winter came back again and summer finery and summer engagements arose      629.8417176122404
 bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity and by the middle of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope that by the following christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the waroffice another regiment should be quartered in meryton      524.1207191975011
 the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching and a fortnight only was wanting of it when a letter arrived from mrs      1300.45813522283
 gardiner which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent      177.19356137798653
 gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july and must be in london again within a month and as that left too short a period for them to go so far and see so much as they had proposed or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on they were obliged to give up the lakes and substitute a more contracted tour and according to the present plan were to go no farther northward than derbyshire      470.9674631927461
 gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction      48.199563998586285
 the town where she had formerly passed some years of her life and where they were now to spend a few days was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of matlock chatsworth dovedale or the peak      1081.4389349908433
 elizabeth was excessively disappointed she had set her heart on seeing the lakes and still thought there might have been time enough      2894.111787379364
 but it was her business to be satisfiedand certainly her temper to be happy and all was soon right again      983.188729499195
 with the mention of derbyshire there were many ideas connected      800.7404947165821
 it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner      2483.6635940542083
 but surely said she i may enter his county with impunity and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me      506.24782756558005
 the period of expectation was now doubled      3269.027341569461
 four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunts arrival      933.1417123868923
 but they did pass away and mr      961.3828248384349
 gardiner with their four children did at length appear at longbourn      177.19356137798653
 the children two girls of six and eight years old and two younger boys were to be left under the particular care of their cousin jane who was the general favourite and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every wayteaching them playing with them and loving them      318.3415767326406
 the gardiners staid only one night at longbourn and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement      386.09069327999066
 one enjoyment was certainthat of suitableness as companions a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniencescheerfulness to enhance every pleasureand affection and intelligence which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad      782.903020359966
 it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay oxford blenheim warwick kenelworth birmingham c      761.7185746352467
 are sufficiently known      51.75681083503038
 a small part of derbyshire is all the present concern      531.7550143920398
 to the little town of lambton the scene of mrs      385.67595642754594
 gardiners former residence and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained they bent their steps after having seen all the principal wonders of the country and within five miles of lambton elizabeth found from her aunt that pemberley was situated      624.7666190268186
 it was not in their direct road nor more than a mile or two out of it      400.0447103951064
 in talking over their route the evening before mrs      107.38512293401688
 gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again      110.99212611339226
 gardiner declared his willingness and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation      165.87300359699287
 my love should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much      167.69578585166872
 said her aunt      811.0220925248268
 a place too with which so many of your acquaintance are connected      486.0331810801793
 elizabeth was distressed      553.6385512922801
 she felt that she had no business at pemberley and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it      1541.7284832217547
 she must own that she was tired of great houses after going over so many she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains      1527.6030520983645
 gardiner abused her stupidity      48.56388609578208
 elizabeth said no morebut her mind could not acquiesce      1418.141328129121
 the possibility of meeting mr      814.6955581649441
 darcy while viewing the place instantly occurred      97.83758319273011
 it would be dreadful      275.1051068147718
 she blushed at the very idea and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk      793.4832284766428
 but against this there were objections and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered      1107.2497811185326
 accordingly when she retired at night she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place what was the name of its proprietor and with no little alarm whether the family were down for the summer      354.79254499992965
 a most welcome negative followed the last questionand her alarms being now removed she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself and when the subject was revived the next morning and she was again applied to could readily answer and with a proper air of indifference that she had not really any dislike to the scheme      667.4898825087396
 to pemberley therefore they were to go      3269.027341569461

 chapter i      620.1082954481221
 elizabeth as they drove along watched for the first appearance of pemberley woods with some perturbation and when at length they turned in at the lodge her spirits were in a high flutter      363.6634405653005
 the park was very large and contained great variety of ground      664.1813722340471
 they entered it in one of its lowest points and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent      593.1615877487261
 elizabeths mind was too full for conversation but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view      792.4290386549904
 they gradually ascended for half a mile and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence where the wood ceased and the eye was instantly caught by pemberley house situated on the opposite side of a valley into which the road with some abruptness wound      246.9195904020825
 it was a large handsome stone building standing well on rising ground and backed by a ridge of high woody hillsand in front a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater but without any artificial appearance      442.60456139310884
 its banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned      902.4873677981599
 elizabeth was delighted      553.6385512922801
 she had never seen a place for which nature had done more or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste      570.3181527679889
 they were all of them warm in their admiration and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of pemberley might be something      917.7549288841042
 they descended the hill crossed the bridge and drove to the door and while examining the nearer aspect of the house all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned      669.9507222211394
 she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken      838.1841865769043
 the housekeeper came a respectablelooking elderly woman much less fine and more civil than she had any notion of finding her      2295.0689452648203
 they followed her into the diningparlour      493.23587565936685
 it was a large wellproportioned room handsomely fitted up      621.7018360250552
 the hill crowned with wood from which they had descended receiving increased abruptness from the distance was a beautiful object      356.3766785522307
 every disposition of the ground was good and she looked on the whole scene the river the trees scattered on its banks and the winding of the valley as far as she could trace it with delight      425.0091323190004
 as they passed into other rooms these objects were taking different positions but from every window there were beauties to be seen      796.1136556102543
 the rooms were lofty and handsome and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor but elizabeth saw with admiration of his taste that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine with less of splendor and more real elegance than the furniture of rosings      462.87980208022583
 and of this place thought she i might have been mistress      151.35170199085533
 with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted      1759.7635913325962
 instead of viewing them as a stranger i might have rejoiced in them as my own and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt      607.3250377825749
but norecollecting herselfthat could never be my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me i should not have been allowed to invite them      767.1645216643407
 this was a lucky recollectionit saved her from something like regret      823.0342705962261
 at length however the question was asked by her uncle and she turned away with alarm while mrs      514.6247966576555
 reynolds replied that he was adding but we expect him tomorrow with a large party of friends      436.64129371947587
 how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day      557.722838216789
 she approached and saw the likeness of mr      2467.5942378739805
 wickham suspended amongst several other miniatures over the mantlepiece      452.9506026625008
 her aunt asked her smilingly how she liked it      232.64422394788394
 the housekeeper came forward and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman the son of her late masters steward who had been brought up by him at his own expence      829.4382212093982
he is now gone into the army she added but i am afraid he has turned out very wild      324.4873849942968
 gardiner looked at her niece with a smile but elizabeth could not return it      77.17135234255605
 and that said mrs      48.563886095782074
 reynolds pointing to another of the miniatures is my masterand very like him      268.4568917887991
 gardiner looking at the picture it is a handsome face      100.25316076713236
 but lizzy you can tell us whether it is like or not      146.90473689264306
 reynoldss respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master      1074.9972338701818
 does that young lady know mr      621.4382623065666
 elizabeth coloured and saida little      215.01817017506332
 yes very handsome      553.6385512922801
 i am sure i know none so handsome but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer larger picture of him than this      293.3972242290235
 this room was my late masters favourite room and these miniatures are just as they used to be then      515.9327210935355
 he was very fond of them      531.8463367350109
 this accounted to elizabeth for mr      603.7985448863138
 wickhams being among them      1081.5754508315883
 reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy drawn when she was only eight years old      237.5872858626267
 and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother      287.54003505248056
 said mr      2056.6665453882724
 yesthe handsomest young lady that ever was seen and so accomplished      753.3892475340454
she plays and sings all day long      1380.2723825932546
 in the next room is a new instrument just come down for hera present from my master she comes here tomorrow with him      440.9141007920148
 gardiner whose manners were easy and pleasant encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks mrs      311.2595982518436
 reynolds either from pride or attachment had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister      521.1345931875687
 is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year      338.7117961722403
 not so much as i could wish sir but i dare say he may spend half his time here and miss darcy is always down for the summer months      325.300835511937
 except thought elizabeth when she goes to ramsgate      8722.223922850213
 if your master would marry you might see more of him      158.47364347444054
 yes sir but i do not know when that will be      835.8512749804571
 i do not know who is good enough for him      86.65830354848481
 gardiner smiled      40.11910197869102
 i say no more than the truth and what every body will say that knows him replied the other      234.47591552712075
 elizabeth thought this was going pretty far and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added i have never had a cross word from him in my life and i have known him ever since he was four years old      584.8454432092755
 this was praise of all others most extraordinary most opposite to her ideas      947.5662987277261
 that he was not a goodtempered man had been her firmest opinion      1019.1679482129941
 her keenest attention was awakened she longed to hear more and was grateful to her uncle for saying there are very few people of whom so much can be said      1236.8466836811263
 you are lucky in having such a master      118.1096785846048
 yes sir i know i am      2308.530143225881
 if i was to go through the world i could not meet with a better      316.84035016450656
 but i have always observed that they who are goodnatured when children are goodnatured when they grow up and he was always the sweetesttempered most generoushearted boy in the world      594.16905498487
 elizabeth almost stared at her      215.01817017506332
can this be mr      190.9288693559034
 thought she      1454.2828608835578
 his father was an excellent man said mrs      738.0229739690235
 yes maam that he was indeed and his son will be just like himjust as affable to the poor      1158.5193435241335
 elizabeth listened wondered doubted and was impatient for more      1418.141328129121
 reynolds could interest her on no other point      107.35057460168989
 she related the subject of the pictures the dimensions of the rooms and the price of the furniture in vain      1441.3686152215312
 gardiner highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master soon led again to the subject and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase      265.5274257547829
 some people call him proud but i am sure i never saw any thing of it      1939.2409472534696
 to my fancy it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men      363.4527172379495
 in what an amiable light does this place him      228.2206770626403
 thought elizabeth      1454.2828608835578
 this fine account of him whispered her aunt as they walked is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend      513.5495497043731
 that is not very likely our authority was too good      451.7728694881259
 on reaching the spacious lobby above they were shewn into a very pretty sittingroom lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below and were informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to miss darcy who had taken a liking to the room when last at pemberley      751.8136592364241
 he is certainly a good brother said elizabeth as she walked towards one of the windows      452.77969932655986
 reynolds anticipated miss darcys delight when she should enter the room      186.34647657186102
 and this is always the way with him she added      220.3233924074947
whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment      489.06791134713984
 there is nothing he would not do for her      1302.7089954291175
 in the former were many good paintings but elizabeth knew nothing of the art and from such as had been already visible below she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcys in crayons whose subjects were usually more interesting and also more intelligible      492.99034915251696
 at last it arrested herand she beheld a striking resemblance of mr      585.0536312759614
 darcy with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her      358.5359069023649
 reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his fathers life time      239.47982627153092
 the commendation bestowed on him by mrs      753.5815562796035
 reynolds was of no trifling nature      149.03516866374105
 what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant      1194.6764211736083
 as a brother a landlord a master she considered how many peoples happiness were in his guardianship      292.7726531205785
how much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow      577.5126746680171
how much of good or evil must be done by him      458.426992523804
 every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character and as she stood before the canvas on which he was represented and fixed his eyes upon herself she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before she remembered its warmth and softened its impropriety of expression      622.8618737641602
 when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen they returned down stairs and taking leave of the housekeeper were consigned over to the gardener who met them at the hall door      614.3967998515302
 as they walked across the lawn towards the river elizabeth turned back to look again her uncle and aunt stopped also and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables      610.8412722104732
 they were within twenty yards of each other and so abrupt was his appearance that it was impossible to avoid his sight      1247.8782805853023
 their eyes instantly met and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush      1003.0762286418638
 he absolutely started and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise but shortly recovering himself advanced towards the party and spoke to elizabeth if not in terms of perfect composure at least of perfect civility      486.9055938807138
 she had instinctively turned away but stopping on his approach received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome      628.9875593517964
 darcy the gardeners expression of surprise on beholding his master must immediately have told it      174.59345206947245
 amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind the few minutes in which they continued together were some of the most uncomfortable of her life      471.87195969983134
 at length every idea seemed to fail him and after standing a few moments without saying a word he suddenly recollected himself and took leave      721.0457539354705
 the others then joined her and expressed their admiration of his figure but elizabeth heard not a word and wholly engrossed by her own feelings followed them in silence      455.42671860657805
 she was overpowered by shame and vexation      1250.1453600446355
 how strange must it appear to him      1061.4526955302235
 it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again      2108.3691837843667
 why did she come      241.5461082312236
 had they been only ten minutes sooner they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination for it was plain that he was that moment arrived that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage      562.8076963083313
 she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting      1631.0192762176448
 and his behaviour so strikingly alteredwhat could it mean      119.87812674913236
 that he should even speak to her was amazing      516.6576574978824
 never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting      289.59676131554545
 what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosings park when he put his letter into her hand      351.5290617637339
 she knew not what to think nor how to account for it      553.6385512922801
 they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it and though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out she distinguished no part of the scene      738.1353287927993
 her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house whichever it might be where mr      793.8852498827382
 she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind in what manner he thought of her and whether in defiance of every thing she was still dear to him      412.1323156362017
 perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease yet there had been that in his voice which was not like ease      703.5021306675222
 whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell but he certainly had not seen her with composure      740.8622299380744
 at length however the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself      630.2683378217987
 they entered the woods and bidding adieu to the river for a while ascended some of the higher grounds whence in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander were many charming views of the valley the opposite hills with the long range of woods overspreading many and occasionally part of the stream      393.26202260149904
 gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park but feared it might be beyond a walk      1449.1623251848844
 with a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round      442.96598157798445
 it settled the matter and they pursued the accustomed circuit which brought them again after some time in a descent among hanging woods to the edge of the water in one of its narrowest parts      1103.3659211269173
 they crossed it by a simple bridge in character with the general air of the scene it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited and the valley here contracted into a glen allowed room only for the stream and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppicewood which bordered it      730.4216201849871
 elizabeth longed to explore its windings but when they had crossed the bridge and perceived their distance from the house mrs      378.6879327056961
 gardiner who was not a great walker could go no farther and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible      233.23430453720823
 her niece was therefore obliged to submit and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river in the nearest direction but their progress was slow for mr      817.2757652175792
 gardiner though seldom able to indulge the taste was very fond of fishing and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water and talking to the man about them that he advanced but little      281.7952380128244
 whilst wandering on in this slow manner they were again surprised and elizabeths astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of mr      282.2487562344791
 darcy approaching them and at no great distance      92.6104592782635
 the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side allowed them to see him before they met      479.629298334242
 elizabeth however astonished was at least more prepared for an interview than before and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness if he really intended to meet them      848.2855873359675
 for a few moments indeed she felt that he would probably strike into some other path      1032.742929936133
 with a glance she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility and to imitate his politeness she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place but she had not got beyond the words delightful and charming when some unlucky recollections obtruded and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her might be mischievously construed      571.0007377238368
 her colour changed and she said no more      212.8548047146844
 gardiner was standing a little behind and on her pausing he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends      213.50562976663758
 this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself      468.2556818662177
 what will be his surprise thought she when he knows who they are      779.8916897979148
 he takes them now for people of fashion      775.4665665986237
 the introduction however was immediately made and as she named their relationship to herself she stole a sly look at him to see how he bore it and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions      638.0281143716645
 that he was surprised by the connexion was evident he sustained it however with fortitude and so far from going away turned back with them and entered into conversation with mr      1053.861254347734
 elizabeth could not but be pleased could not but triumph      992.8478108983953
 it was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush      450.6441012255241
 she listened most attentively to all that passed between them and gloried in every expression every sentence of her uncle which marked his intelligence his taste or his good manners      1604.1154848660424
 the conversation soon turned upon fishing and she heard mr      687.0037055123042
 darcy invite him with the greatest civility to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport      563.0123568560199
 gardiner who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth gave her a look expressive of her wonder      266.0041917722613
 elizabeth said nothing but it gratified her exceedingly the compliment must be all for herself      657.0606156458637
 it cannot be for me it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened      507.3440204963756
 my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this      933.1417123868924
 it is impossible that he should still love me      658.5030647809108
 after walking some time in this way the two ladies in front the two gentlemen behind on resuming their places after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious waterplant there chanced to be a little alteration      873.3972077791316
 it originated in mrs      275.1051068147718
 gardiner who fatigued by the exercise of the morning found elizabeths arm inadequate to her support and consequently preferred her husbands      256.28420794846414
 darcy took her place by her niece and they walked on together      122.76491935212877
 she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place and accordingly began by observing that his arrival had been very unexpectedfor your housekeeper she added informed us that you would certainly not be here till tomorrow and indeed before we left bakewell we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country      831.435840440003
 he acknowledged the truth of it all and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling      432.9399240722451
 they will join me early tomorrow he continued and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with youmr      418.53834730688436
 bingley and his sisters      327.15695039771015
 elizabeth answered only by a slight bow      457.17126674288704
 her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr      157.6648585937429
 bingleys name had been last mentioned between them and if she might judge from his complexion his mind was not very differently engaged      699.1279167859574
 the surprise of such an application was great indeed it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it      726.9840912862743
 she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother and without looking farther it was satisfactory it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her      1460.1820618458037
 they now walked on in silence each of them deep in thought      483.43109558397254
 elizabeth was not comfortable that was impossible but she was flattered and pleased      851.7208897787142
 his wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind      341.9171239896363
 they soon outstripped the others and when they had reached the carriage mr      246.88546218184018
 gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind      110.99212611339226
 he then asked her to walk into the housebut she declared herself not tired and they stood together on the lawn      555.5125707835327
 at such a time much might have been said and silence was very awkward      619.8806614350735
 she wanted to talk but there seemed an embargo on every subject      1073.4043398695117
 at last she recollected that she had been travelling and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance      896.0177329085267
 yet time and her aunt moved slowlyand her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the têteàtête was over      392.7207019353327
 on mr      40.11910197869102
 gardiners coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment but this was declined and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness      530.4040441319091
 darcy handed the ladies into the carriage and when it drove off elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house      183.29874320328994
 the observations of her uncle and aunt now began and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected      674.1728624239756
 he is perfectly well behaved polite and unassuming said her uncle      1387.0590527617496
 there is something a little stately in him to be sure replied her aunt but it is confined to his air and is not unbecoming      729.0686461497418
 i can now say with the housekeeper that though some people may call him proud i have seen nothing of it      347.4725851364035
 i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us      789.8859080790944
 it was more than civil it was really attentive and there was no necessity for such attention      671.7340241644739
 his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling      358.35447209733553
 to be sure lizzy said her aunt he is not so handsome as wickham or rather he has not wickhams countenance for his features are perfectly good      338.9229899977626
 but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable      829.6497565957662
 but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities replied her uncle      1237.6801428119936
 elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character but said nothing      980.2767804416587
 from what we have seen of him continued mrs      450.75050524967867
 gardiner i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body as he has done by poor wickham      108.5876826617952
 he has not an illnatured look      160.70162859206835
 on the contrary there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks      338.1615187613163
 and there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart      997.9149176897223
 but to be sure the good lady who shewed us the house did give him a most flaming character      1554.126531622349
 i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes      94.48952093091286
 but he is a liberal master i suppose and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue      543.0299508157273
 elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham and therefore gave them to understand in as guarded a manner as she could that by what she had heard from his relations in kent his actions were capable of a very different construction and that his character was by no means so faulty nor wickhams so amiable as they had been considered in hertfordshire      491.3681249244299
 in confirmation of this she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected without actually naming her authority but stating it to be such as might be relied on      552.444733000062
 gardiner was surprised and concerned but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures every idea gave way to the charm of recollection and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of any thing else      546.1064264745819
 the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends and she could do nothing but think and think with wonder of mr      961.0870191351702
 darcys civility and above all of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister      277.7928661371856
 elizabeth had settled it that mr      175.26129507828713
 darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching pemberley and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning      342.78351162632583
 but her conclusion was false for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton these visitors came      385.04107152660754
 they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle driving up the street      687.3120592173167
 elizabeth immediately recognising the livery guessed what it meant and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she expected      862.974368255374
 her uncle and aunt were all amazement and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke joined to the circumstance itself and many of the circumstances of the preceding day opened to them a new idea on the business      444.86662440367473
 nothing had ever suggested it before but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece      572.6072762070388
 while these newlyborn notions were passing in their heads the perturbation of elizabeths feelings was every moment increasing      1265.5874683617667
 she was quite amazed at her own discomposure but amongst other causes of disquiet she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour and more than commonly anxious to please she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her      796.316186257451
 she retreated from the window fearful of being seen and as she walked up and down the room endeavouring to compose herself saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made every thing worse      954.4148856950305
 miss darcy and her brother appeared and this formidable introduction took place      566.3725691047072
 with astonishment did elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself      1096.0558690008572
 since her being at lambton she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy      723.9195453238323
 she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable      352.04894820209034
 miss darcy was tall and on a larger scale than elizabeth and though little more than sixteen her figure was formed and her appearance womanly and graceful      331.1561822326026
 she was less handsome than her brother but there was sense and good humour in her face and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle      1481.3506577904718
 elizabeth who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr      415.0254110069966
 they had not been long together before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her and she had barely time to express her satisfaction and prepare for such a visitor when bingleys quick step was heard on the stairs and in a moment he entered the room      422.23188440835463
 all elizabeths anger against him had been long done away but had she still felt any it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again      337.78144726905015
 to mr      1454.2828608835578
 gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself      92.2442422091142
 the whole party before them indeed excited a lively attention      814.6955581649441
 the suspicions which had just arisen of mr      2056.6665453882724
 darcy and their niece directed their observation towards each with an earnest though guarded enquiry and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love      442.53071067538843
 of the ladys sensations they remained a little in doubt but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough      845.0966055501153
 elizabeth on her side had much to do      902.4873677981599
 she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors she wanted to compose her own and to make herself agreeable to all and in the latter object where she feared most to fail she was most sure of success for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour      720.3825589393471
 bingley was ready georgiana was eager and darcy determined to be pleased      581.6040686906538
 in seeing bingley her thoughts naturally flew to her sister and oh      639.7022747348939
 how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner      160.03446527129842
 sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her he was trying to trace a resemblance      1138.5720949434285
 but though this might be imaginary she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy who had been set up as a rival of jane      655.5509486997976
 no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard      41.97494270806893
 nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister      189.86247251268074
 on this point she was soon satisfied and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted which in her anxious interpretation denoted a recollection of jane not untinctured by tenderness and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her had he dared      586.4592962167346
 he observed to her at a moment when the others were talking together and in a tone which had something of real regret that it was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her and before she could reply he added it is above eight months      988.4009916512243
 elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact and he afterwards took occasion to ask her when unattended to by any of the rest whether all her sisters were at longbourn      793.7727785662728
 there was not much in the question nor in the preceding remark but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning      672.8745075411489
 darcy himself but whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general complaisance and in all that he said she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove had at least outlived one day      845.536757889484
 when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace when she saw him thus civil not only to herself but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage the difference the change was so great and struck so forcibly on her mind that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible      393.95783640127866
 never even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield or his dignified relations at rosings had she seen him so desirous to please so free from selfconsequence or unbending reserve as now when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings      419.89943789944044
 darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing mr      155.83694985555644
 gardiner and miss bennet to dinner at pemberley before they left the country      86.0671008422106
 miss darcy though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations readily obeyed      349.2264854163352
 gardiner looked at her niece desirous of knowing how she whom the invitation most concerned felt disposed as to its acceptance but elizabeth had turned away her head      212.82877845226673
 presuming however that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal and seeing in her husband who was fond of society a perfect willingness to accept it she ventured to engage for her attendance and the day after the next was fixed on      742.8643815731433
 bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again having still a great deal to say to her and many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends      1670.948526561378
 elizabeth construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister was pleased and on this account as well as some others found herself when their visitors left them capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been little      313.4977562532791
 eager to be alone and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley and then hurried away to dress      444.1233642187225
 but she had no reason to fear mr      2056.6665453882724
 gardiners curiosity it was not their wish to force her communication      200.99287552346038
 darcy than they had before any idea of it was evident that he was very much in love with her      179.83779903155263
 they saw much to interest but nothing to justify enquiry      942.5040812538138
 darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well and as far as their acquaintance reached there was no fault to find      518.0693301996403
 they could not be untouched by his politeness and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servants report without any reference to any other account the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognised it for mr      579.3078445949061
 neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight      239.4680184877613
 they had nothing to accuse him of but pride pride he probably had and if not it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small markettown where the family did not visit      348.6692931454532
 it was acknowledged however that he was a liberal man and did much good among the poor      583.3630977690142
 with respect to wickham the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood it was yet a well known fact that on his quitting derbyshire he had left many debts behind him which mr      755.2940678244494
 darcy afterwards discharged      46.64598115839911
 as for elizabeth her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last and the evening though as it passed it seemed long was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out      980.2818608724998
 she certainly did not hate him      1547.9969552007517
 no hatred had vanished long ago and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him that could be so called      150.11696154893028
 the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities though at first unwillingly admitted had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his favour and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light which yesterday had produced      652.677686205317
 but above all above respect and esteem there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked      410.63810464111185
 it was gratitude      522.6542288787506
gratitude not merely for having once loved her but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection      324.1971500893294
 such a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but gratitudefor to love ardent love it must be attributed and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged as by no means unpleasing though it could not be exactly defined      433.4372753592404
 she respected she esteemed she was grateful to him she felt a real interest in his welfare and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power which her fancy told her she still possessed of bringing on the renewal of his addresses      2005.6223001428584
 it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and niece that such a striking civility as miss darcys in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley for she had reached it only to a late breakfast ought to be imitated though it could not be equalled by some exertion of politeness on their side and consequently that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning      866.3984244844248
 they were therefore to go      814.6955581649441
elizabeth was pleased though when she asked herself the reason she had very little to say in reply      1468.2454408908952
 gardiner left them soon after breakfast      48.67533438014639
 the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon      881.0114463346447
 convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingleys dislike of her had originated in jealousy she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her and was curious to know with how much civility on that ladys side the acquaintance would now be renewed      793.8893952740011
 on reaching the house they were shewn through the hall into the saloon whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer      239.98649174397804
 in this room they were received by miss darcy who was sitting there with mrs      335.2086553516559
 hurst and miss bingley and the lady with whom she lived in london      269.9263260846946
 georgianas reception of them was very civil but attended with all that embarrassment which though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved      658.7826219498625
 gardiner and her niece however did her justice and pitied her      96.11536530371642
 hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey and on their being seated a pause awkward as such pauses must always be succeeded for a few moments      587.9687569045981
 it was first broken by mrs      516.7497138521829
 annesley a genteel agreeablelooking woman whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others and between her and mrs      723.7454869843438
 gardiner with occasional help from elizabeth the conversation was carried on      177.19356137798653
 miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard      565.5965996455709
 elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley and that she could not speak a word especially to miss darcy without calling her attention      954.225133654045
 this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much      459.7313694177778
 her own thoughts were employing her      149.03516866374105
 she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room      7144.558240082823
 she wished she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them and whether she wished or feared it most she could scarcely determine      1158.2954058569098
 she answered with equal indifference and brevity and the other said no more      1699.5064784404922
 the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat cake and a variety of all the finest fruits in season but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs      440.92660506318106
 annesley to miss darcy had been given to remind her of her post      479.8112886909558
 there was now employment for the whole party for though they could not all talk they could all eat and the beautiful pyramids of grapes nectarines and peaches soon collected them round the table      1163.5806166057012
 while thus engaged elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr      569.4499126679386
 darcy by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room and then though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate she began to regret that he came      651.4312693290104
 he had been some time with mr      137.80852986475443
 gardiner who with two or three other gentlemen from the house was engaged by the river and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning      408.76753066385174
 no sooner did he appear than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrasseda resolution the more necessary to be made but perhaps not the more easily kept because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room      589.222715918839
 in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingleys in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects for jealousy had not yet made her desperate and her attentions to mr      549.2381108776688
 darcy were by no means over      113.50930596523533
 miss bingley saw all this likewise and in the imprudence of anger took the first opportunity of saying with sneering civility pray miss eliza are not the shire militia removed from meryton      687.4553077689746
 they must be a great loss to your family      1229.5237429804772
 while she spoke an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened complexion earnestly looking at her and his sister overcome with confusion and unable to lift up her eyes      356.8131535773403
 had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcys opinion and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps      408.6000331248087
 not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcys meditated elopement      164.93339435297457
 to no creature had it been revealed where secresy was possible except to elizabeth and from all bingleys connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him of their becoming hereafter her own      757.0844153741784
 he had certainly formed such a plan and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend      272.8001684623027
 elizabeths collected behaviour however soon quieted his emotion and as miss bingley vexed and disappointed dared not approach nearer to wickham georgiana also recovered in time though not enough to be able to speak any more      775.5642277705612
 her brother whose eye she feared to meet scarcely recollected her interest in the affair and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully      1334.992538973849
 their visit did not continue long after the question and answer abovementioned and while mr      356.3209474997543
 darcy was attending them to their carriage miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeths person behaviour and dress      363.32559773906536
 but georgiana would not join her      493.23587565936685
 her brothers recommendation was enough to ensure her favour his judgment could not err and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable      710.0668207496856
 darcy she cried i never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter      256.07174652391194
 she is grown so brown and coarse      1393.7796946031776
 however little mr      40.11910197869101
 darcy might have liked such an address he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tannedno miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer      226.4815058445767
 her nose wants character there is nothing marked in its lines      702.8316888829822
 her teeth are tolerable but not out of the common way and as for her eyes which have sometimes been called so fine i never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them      925.291614646182
 they have a sharp shrewish look which i do not like at all and in her air altogether there is a selfsufficiency without fashion which is intolerable      630.4023861646783
 persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth this was not the best method of recommending herself but angry people are not always wise and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled she had all the success she expected      785.6185314352472
 he was resolutely silent however and from a determination of making him speak she continued i remember when we first knew her in hertfordshire how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty and i particularly recollect your saying one night after they had been dining at netherfield she a beauty      708.0687324192387
i should as soon call her mother a wit      110.12041675515418
 but afterwards she seemed to improve on you and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time      1604.9947950494243
 he then went away and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself      761.5064796624184
 the looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention      263.6205990192587
 they talked of his sister his friends his house his fruit of every thing but himself yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs      774.902158740358
 gardiner thought of him and mrs      48.67533438014639
 gardiner would have been highly gratified by her nieces beginning the subject      156.56326726255972
 chapter iv      620.1082954481221
 elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane on their first arrival at lambton and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there but on the third her repining was over and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere      377.6755859618259
 elizabeth was not surprised at it as jane had written the direction remarkably ill      1228.711976284636
 they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in and her uncle and aunt leaving her to enjoy them in quiet set off by themselves      700.9218963698057
 the one missent must be first attended to it had been written five days ago      1715.1864356391816
 the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements with such news as the country afforded but the latter half which was dated a day later and written in evident agitation gave more important intelligence      325.76793412833575
 it was to this effect since writing the above dearest lizzy something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature but i am afraid of alarming yoube assured that we are all well      1647.3199810327535
 what i have to say relates to poor lydia      228.2206770626403
imagine our surprise      765.6333277059217
 so imprudent a match on both sides      1393.7796946031776
but i am willing to hope the best and that his character has been misunderstood      348.68728735815694
 thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him but this step and let us rejoice over it marks nothing bad at heart      372.9110835486887
 his choice is disinterested at least for he must know my father can give her nothing      418.6130356420387
 our poor mother is sadly grieved      149.03516866374105
 my father bears it better      678.2774000062835
 they were off saturday night about twelve as is conjectured but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight      1365.7660631154608
 the express was sent off directly      1832.2815889285312
 colonel forster gives us reason to expect him here soon      285.2348211322073
 lydia left a few lines for his wife informing her of their intention      236.3688922438836
 i must conclude for i cannot be long from my poor mother      747.2441527960751
 i am afraid you will not be able to make it out but i hardly know what i have written      141.2444881655349
 without allowing herself time for consideration and scarcely knowing what she felt elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the other and opening it with the utmost impatience read as follows it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first      531.763815441481
 by this time my dearest sister you have received my hurried letter i wish this may be more intelligible but though not confined for time my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer for being coherent      1039.8688561868569
 dearest lizzy i hardly know what i would write but i have bad news for you and it cannot be delayed      203.1591338132512
 imprudent as a marriage between mr      603.7985448863138
 wickham and our poor lydia would be we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland      130.47862667529927
 colonel forster came yesterday having left brighton the day before not many hours after the express      598.3262344382654
 though lydias short letter to mrs      132.77524072035618
 f      40.11910197869102
 gave them to understand that they were going to gretna green something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that w      781.9850176204251
 never intended to go there or to marry lydia at all which was repeated to colonel f      613.9829309261346
 who instantly taking the alarm set off from b      543.1115498152592
 intending to trace their route      904.0537140354138
 he did trace them easily to clapham but no farther for on entering that place they removed into a hackneycoach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom      581.2106117998521
 all that is known after this is that they were seen to continue the london road      191.12713506816527
 i know not what to think      43.75391731724056
 after making every possible enquiry on that side london colonel f      679.0557918932234
 came on into hertfordshire anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes and at the inns in barnet and hatfield but without any success no such people had been seen to pass through      430.04863620886067
 i am sincerely grieved for him and mrs      386.45942387463344
 f      40.11910197869102
 but no one can throw any blame on them      213.70770124255236
 our distress my dear lizzy is very great      114.56545315252454
 my father and mother believe the worst but i cannot think so ill of him      311.0506797300221
 many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of lydias connections which is not likely can i suppose her so lost to every thing      853.5484233597592
impossible      59.60033917467496
 i grieve to find however that colonel f      122.26523336966544
 is not disposed to depend upon their marriage he shook his head when i expressed my hopes and said he feared w      760.4654092477566
 was not a man to be trusted      424.4182090510754
 my poor mother is really ill and keeps her room      425.8325071886167
 could she exert herself it would be better but this is not to be expected and as to my father i never in my life saw him so affected      1140.8651475471088
 poor kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder      307.3906523979169
 i am truly glad dearest lizzy that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes but now as the first shock is over shall i own that i long for your return      226.12404877737453
 i am not so selfish however as to press for it if inconvenient      272.52512271577126
 adieu      40.11910197869102
 i take up my pen again to do what i have just told you i would not but circumstances are such that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible      301.308959187101
 i know my dear uncle and aunt so well that i am not afraid of requesting it though i have still something more to ask of the former      162.06207397617794
 my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly to try to discover her      541.7736512419725
 what he means to do i am sure i know not but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again tomorrow evening      414.4730757563648
 in such an exigence my uncles advice and assistance would be every thing in the world he will immediately comprehend what i must feel and i rely upon his goodness      593.3798361463184
 where where is my uncle      814.6955581649441
 cried elizabeth darting from her seat as she finished the letter in eagerness to follow him without losing a moment of the time so precious but as she reached the door it was opened by a servant and mr      532.2004410139101
 darcy appeared      40.11910197869102
 her pale face and impetuous manner made him start and before he could recover himself enough to speak she in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydias situation hastily exclaimed i beg your pardon but i must leave you      775.0551768620543
 i must find mr      327.15695039771015
 gardiner this moment on business that cannot be delayed i have not an instant to lose      321.5491785967199
 good god      40.11910197869102
 what is the matter      270.45643337730826
 cried he with more feeling than politeness then recollecting himself i will not detain you a minute but let me or let the servant go after mr      643.0329263718291
 you are not well enoughyou cannot go yourself      118.1096785846048
 elizabeth hesitated but her knees trembled under her and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them      1517.3055117904214
 calling back the servant therefore she commissioned him though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible to fetch his master and mistress home instantly      488.6859715622492
 on his quitting the room she sat down unable to support herself and looking so miserably ill that it was impossible for darcy to leave her or to refrain from saying in a tone of gentleness and commiseration let me call your maid      375.72124163390504
 is there nothing you could take to give you present relief      736.8791745000457
a glass of wineshall i get you one      413.5016729461455
you are very ill      40.11910197869102
 there is nothing the matter with me      1061.4526955302235
 i am quite well      51.161949297677936
 i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn      218.5405980406024
 she burst into tears as she alluded to it and for a few minutes could not speak another word      1120.9351503563566
 darcy in wretched suspense could only say something indistinctly of his concern and observe her in compassionate silence      421.75432499134394
 at length she spoke again      196.53507063293773
 i have just had a letter from jane with such dreadful news      319.7013638092552
 my youngest sister has left all her friendshas elopedhas thrown herself into the power ofof mr      829.1817603222989
 they are gone off together from brighton      367.6531739013711
 you know him too well to doubt the rest      89.09673705835279
 she has no money no connections nothing that can tempt him toshe is lost for ever      537.4690185051979
 darcy was fixed in astonishment      139.75505364770575
 when i consider she added in a yet more agitated voice that i might have prevented it      375.36394526014544
i who knew what he was      144.80475927254847
 had i but explained some part of it onlysome part of what i learnt to my own family      373.24938923688205
 had his character been known this could not have happened      185.79085828812782
 but it is all all too late now      689.7671678054285
 i am grieved indeed cried darcy grievedshocked      148.44344286524932
 but is it certain absolutely certain      526.8709402963223
they left brighton together on sunday night and were traced almost to london but not beyond they are certainly not gone to scotland      738.8363885939924
 and what has been done what has been attempted to recover her      156.59972935730832
 my father is gone to london and jane has written to beg my uncles immediate assistance and we shall be off i hope in half an hour      297.53945889829083
 but nothing can be done i know very well that nothing can be done      301.3977480841412
 how is such a man to be worked on      586.5929186828645
 how are they even to be discovered      124.8164466359274
 i have not the smallest hope      49.69641882427861
 it is every way horrible      202.60430451798896
 darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence      97.83758319273011
 but i knew noti was afraid of doing too much      418.53834730688436
 wretched wretched mistake      439.4232093657577
 darcy made no answer      48.56388609578208
 he seemed scarcely to hear her and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation his brow contracted his air gloomy      1498.9418689255997
 elizabeth soon observed and instantly understood it      457.17126674288704
 she could neither wonder nor condemn but the belief of his selfconquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom afforded no palliation of her distress      497.40309105540535
 but self though it would intrude could not engross her      1750.9223374019423
 lydiathe humiliation the misery she was bringing on them all soon swallowed up every private care and covering her face with her handkerchief elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else and after a pause of several minutes was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion who in a manner which though it spoke compassion spoke likewise restraint said i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay but real though unavailing concern      461.3761827822662
 would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress      324.6471975846682
but i will not torment you with vain wishes which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks      324.6848873397313
 this unfortunate affair will i fear prevent my sisters having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley today      503.42893841494976
 be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy      383.6079625175302
 say that urgent business calls us home immediately      334.416189291973
 conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible      583.4514217198866
 he readily assured her of his secrecyagain expressed his sorrow for her distress wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope and leaving his compliments for her relations with only one serious parting look went away      488.92187811333156
 as he quitted the room elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance so full of contradictions and varieties sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination      900.2862661971154
 if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection elizabeths change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty      311.5284420722883
 but if otherwise if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object and even before two words have been exchanged nothing can be said in her defence except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for wickham and that its illsuccess might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment      539.2689731153434
 never since reading janes second letter had she entertained a hope of wickhams meaning to marry her      630.2913822477958
 no one but jane she thought could flatter herself with such an expectation      234.06655531183657
 surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement      1132.418067569532
 while the contents of the first letter remained on her mind she was all surpriseall astonishment that wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible      1384.9121866110736
 but now it was all too natural      344.6535336432692
 for such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey      801.3508078852379
 she had never perceived while the regiment was in hertfordshire that lydia had any partiality for him but she was convinced that lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body      675.965481739072
 sometimes one officer sometimes another had been her favourite as their attentions raised them in her opinion      2532.9502186140326
 her affections had been continually fluctuating but never without an object      1776.8288713247161
 she was wild to be at hometo hear to see to be upon the spot to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her in a family so deranged a father absent a mother incapable of exertion and requiring constant attendance and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia her uncles interference seemed of the utmost importance and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience was severe      913.5829711456055
 gardiner had hurried back in alarm supposing by the servants account that their niece was taken suddenly illbut satisfying them instantly on that head she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons reading the two letters aloud and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy      229.09776558058044
though lydia had never been a favourite with them mr      82.26417369553651
 gardiner could not but be deeply affected      48.199563998586285
 not lydia only but all were concerned in it and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror mr      138.34544282749667
 gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power      126.0476611229174
elizabeth though expecting no less thanked him with tears of gratitude and all three being actuated by one spirit every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled      773.1856835422451
 they were to be off as soon as possible      1138.3849417824417
 but what is to be done about pemberley      683.9145616261229
 darcy was here when you sent for uswas it so      364.2221270352451
 that is all settled repeated the other as she ran into her room to prepare      634.6570969789543
 and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth      230.1616230854732
 oh that i knew how it was      119.37693132615247
 but wishes were vain or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour      1057.3886858636681
 had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself but she had her share of business as well as her aunt and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in lambton with false excuses for their sudden departure      611.4082688556798
 an hour however saw the whole completed and mr      43.67403369673303
 i have been thinking it over again elizabeth said her uncle as they drove from the town and really upon serious consideration i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter      214.2952816628674
 it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless and who was actually staying in his colonels family that i am strongly inclined to hope the best      414.38663651045096
 could he expect that her friends would not step forward      152.4533622711289
 could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment after such an affront to colonel forster      1107.378985540658
 his temptation is not adequate to the risk      2194.892161782015
 cried elizabeth brightening up for a moment      291.00574026113895
 upon my word said mrs      193.76542062357612
 gardiner i begin to be of your uncles opinion      110.99212611339226
 it is really too great a violation of decency honour and interest for him to be guilty of it      223.19438655814866
 i cannot think so very ill of wickham      93.40297427451034
 can you yourself lizzy so wholly give him up as to believe him capable of it      165.57655694112358
 not perhaps of neglecting his own interest      1061.4526955302235
 if indeed it should be so      135.55802715712665
 but i dare not hope it      526.8709402963223
 why should they not go on to scotland if that had been the case      206.36019223080186
 gardiner there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland      258.37494093934606
 but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption      1101.6486424768757
 and besides no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road      808.1578826635564
 well thensupposing them to be in london      961.3828248384349
 they may be there though for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptionable purpose      897.8158658397589
 it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side and it might strike them that they could be more economically though less expeditiously married in london than in scotland      353.4541095604004
 but why all this secrecy      814.6955581649441
 why any fear of detection      168.68259607116462
 why must their marriage be private      493.23587565936685
 no no this is not likely      40.11910197869101
 his most particular friend you see by janes account was persuaded of his never intending to marry her      829.6537952901028
 wickham will never marry a woman without some money      452.9506026625008
 he cannot afford it      287.24835050978845
 and what claims has lydia what attractions has she beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well      324.81021044759973
 as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce      946.8118871515147
 but as to your other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good      382.4620706579947
 lydia has no brothers to step forward and he might imagine from my fathers behaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that he would do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in such a matter      384.0968075322799
 but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage      189.96448722599365
 it does seem and it is most shocking indeed replied elizabeth with tears in her eyes that a sisters sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt      1103.9404258787386
 perhaps i am not doing her justice      1307.109337505473
 but she is very young she has never been taught to think on serious subjects and for the last half year nay for a twelvemonth she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity      488.44786050587237
 she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way      649.5229694670995
 since the shire were first quartered in meryton nothing but love flirtation and officers have been in her head      1556.5120556975432
 she has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give greaterwhat shall i call it      696.9741826658834
 and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman      223.85581779839367
 but you see that jane said her aunt does not think so ill of wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt      624.4044900152934
 of whom does jane ever think ill      273.86080335426425
 and who is there whatever might be their former conduct that she would believe capable of such an attempt till it were proved against them      682.1508491496743
 but jane knows as well as i do what wickham really is      288.95205448290636
 we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word      575.6248672221474
 that he has neither integrity nor honour      348.16526261803807
 that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating      696.3565090071206
 and do you really know all this      44.74640931628707
 i do indeed replied elizabeth colouring      43.75391731724056
 i told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to mr      76.21966218932734
 darcy and you yourself when last at longbourn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him      210.567564420558
 and there are other circumstances which i am not at libertywhich it is not worth while to relate but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless      576.1470787543593
 from what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud reserved disagreeable girl      545.8811725677195
 yet he knew to the contrary himself      1061.4526955302235
 he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her      853.2258699542157
 but does lydia know nothing of this      344.6535336432692
 can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand      648.0505432160742
that that is the worst of all      971.1785054053564
 till i was in kent and saw so much both of mr      315.13128851206596
 darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam i was ignorant of the truth myself      70.88735047115343
 and when i returned home the shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnights time      254.31264572640353
 as that was the case neither jane to whom i related the whole nor i thought it necessary to make our knowledge public for of what use could it apparently be to any one that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown      725.7844503434703
 and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mrs      288.95205448290636
 forster the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me      994.2059500089586
 that she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head      565.538446518105
 that such a consequence as this should ensue you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts      715.1008816842926
 when they all removed to brighton therefore you had no reason i suppose to believe them fond of each other      412.7891349469677
 not the slightest      40.11910197869101
 i can remember no symptom of affection on either side and had any thing of the kind been perceptible you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away      1634.6055295578858
 when first he entered the corps she was ready enough to admire him but so we all were      1157.338762116514
 every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months but he never distinguished her by any particular attention and consequently after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others of the regiment who treated her with more distinction again became her favourites      456.367059573373
 it may be easily believed that however little of novelty could be added to their fears hopes and conjectures on this interesting subject by its repeated discussion no other could detain them from it long during the whole of the journey      746.8353617340613
 from elizabeths thoughts it was never absent      931.2195213178684
 fixed there by the keenest of all anguish self reproach she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness      1385.1004757904725
 they travelled as expeditiously as possible and sleeping one night on the road reached longbourn by dinnertime the next day      658.193321340418
 it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations      712.0299548666057
 the little gardiners attracted by the sight of a chaise were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock and when the carriage drove up to the door the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies in a variety of capers and frisks was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome      784.1885327053452
 elizabeth jumped out and after giving each of them an hasty kiss hurried into the vestibule where jane who came running down stairs from her mothers apartment immediately met her      699.0848249682393
 elizabeth as she affectionately embraced her whilst tears filled the eyes of both lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives      1097.734973062714
 not yet replied jane      241.5461082312236
 but now that my dear uncle is come i hope every thing will be well      818.5589154704751
 is my father in town      1192.9060274333444
 yes he went on tuesday as i wrote you word      2056.6665453882733
 and have you heard from him often      47.73245534992964
 we have heard only once      814.6955581649441
 he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety and to give me his directions which i particularly begged him to do      960.1987216060683
 he merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention      425.24957925918625
 and my motherhow is she      46.74347398462845
 my mother is tolerably well i trust though her spirits are greatly shaken      818.1251813659544
 she does not yet leave her dressingroom      420.13736348096677
 mary and kitty thank heaven      225.75951233528167
 are quite well      51.75681083503038
 but youhow are you      1729.4435253892393
 cried elizabeth      620.1082954481221
 you look pale      40.11910197869101
 how much you must have gone through      344.65353364326927
 gardiner were engaged with their children was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party      336.59322787055436
 jane ran to her uncle and aunt and welcomed and thanked them both with alternate smiles and tears      156.11224756040912
 bennet to whose apartment they all repaired after a few minutes conversation together received them exactly as might be expected with tears and lamentations of regret invectives against the villanous conduct of wickham and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing      1036.1012540104894
 if i had been able said she to carry my point of going to brighton with all my family this would not have happened but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her      494.6105237962466
 why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight      267.25063562027174
 i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after      971.6117196039522
 i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her but i was overruled as i always am      379.9697592066436
 poor dear child      553.6385512922801
 bennet gone away and i know he will fight wickham wherever he meets him and then he will be killed and what is to become of us all      294.8701428319394
 the collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave and if you are not kind to us brother i do not know what we shall do      406.99775852634394
 they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas and mr      232.64422394788394
 gardiner after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family told her that he meant to be in london the very next day and would assist mr      363.33949235229244
 bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia      3269.027341569461
 do not give way to useless alarm added he though it is right to be prepared for the worst there is no occasion to look on it as certain      490.4810820636356
 it is not quite a week since they left brighton      440.89451723951464
 as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother and make him come home with me to gracechurch street and then we may consult together as to what is to be done      315.11339577211953
 bennet that is exactly what i could most wish for      1790.4322196000549
 and now do when you get to town find them out wherever they may be and if they are not married already make them marry      183.83433673747888
 and as for wedding clothes do not let them wait for that but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses to buy them after they are married      287.3387418066353
 and above all things keep mr      49.13498980390302
 bennet from fighting      7640.1422354822
 tell him what a dreadful state i am inthat i am frightened out of my wits and have such tremblings such flutterings all over me such spasms in my side and pains in my head and such beatings at heart that i can get no rest by night nor by day      474.92158384448527
 and tell my dear lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me for she does not know which are the best warehouses      172.23559793150642
 oh brother how kind you are      149.03516866374105
 i know you will contrive it all      120.54515107650349
 but mr      2056.6665453882724
 gardiner though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause could not avoid recommending moderation to her as well in her hopes as her fears and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper who attended in the absence of her daughters      317.0494393738515
 in the diningroom they were soon joined by mary and kitty who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before      327.6133720775408
 one came from her books and the other from her toilette      1070.729234319018
 the faces of both however were tolerably calm and no change was visible in either except that the loss of her favourite sister or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business had given something more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty      955.0260458611809
 as for mary she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection soon after they were seated at table this is a most unfortunate affair and will probably be much talked of      880.9343628908159
 but we must stem the tide of malice and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation      3828.153746827037
 then perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying she added unhappy as the event must be for lydia we may draw from it this useful lesson that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievablethat one false step involves her in endless ruinthat her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautifuland that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex      298.1214677292749
 elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement but was too much oppressed to make any reply      1167.112673288141
 mary however continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them      354.55029621280437
 in the afternoon the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries which jane was equally eager to satisfy      750.1522013475036
 give me farther particulars      45.693014538637115
 had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place      149.91911389279497
 they must have seen them together for ever      704.8260778148694
 colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality especially on lydias side but nothing to give him any alarm      293.18475277488943
 i am so grieved for him      184.61315922261164
 his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost      666.2014950084679
 he was coming to us in order to assure us of his concern before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland when that apprehension first got abroad it hastened his journey      374.89431050934854
 and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry      273.534527110695
 did he know of their intending to go off      101.9577091801349
 had colonel forster seen denny himself      113.50930596523533
 and till colonel forster came himself not one of you entertained a doubt i suppose of their being really married      163.3423533740485
 how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains      548.9611405882673
 i felt a little uneasya little fearful of my sisters happiness with him in marriage because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right      424.97779729948275
 my father and mother knew nothing of that they only felt how imprudent a match it must be      510.2922598081223
 kitty then owned with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us that in lydias last letter she had prepared her for such a step      425.9523975254709
 she had known it seems of their being in love with each other many weeks      203.89169505174058
 but not before they went to brighton      344.6535336432692
 and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself      74.17664821449326
 does he know his real character      621.4382623065666
 and since this sad affair has taken place it is said that he left meryton greatly in debt but i hope this may be false      503.72289715081774
 oh jane had we been less secret had we told what we knew of him this could not have happened      443.9889925732009
 perhaps it would have been better replied her sister      1561.3654889374807
 but to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were seemed unjustifiable      2774.5244528184553
 we acted with the best intentions      1395.516329178726
 could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydias note to his wife      99.93631141715089
 he brought it with him for us to see      230.81708400330606
 jane then took it from her pocketbook and gave it to elizabeth      525.6646031827678
 these were the contents my dear harriet you will laugh when you know where i am gone and i cannot help laughing myself at your surprise tomorrow morning as soon as i am missed      1462.703371939672
 i am going to gretna green and if you cannot guess with who i shall think you a simpleton for there is but one man in the world i love and he is an angel      198.57251380074197
 i should never be happy without him so think it no harm to be off      210.09283293339817
 you need not send them word at longbourn of my going if you do not like it for it will make the surprise the greater when i write to them and sign my name lydia wickham      344.6508304361305
 what a good joke it will be      371.399249822332
 i can hardly write for laughing      123.79331896756256
 pray make my excuses to pratt for not keeping my engagement and dancing with him tonight      789.5356589369421
 i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up      520.6124205576607
 good bye      40.11910197869102
 give my love to colonel forster i hope you will drink to our good journey      323.77918721940677
 your affectionate friend lydia bennet      40.119101978691035
 thoughtless thoughtless lydia      439.4232093657577
 cried elizabeth when she had finished it      291.00574026113895
 but at least it shews that she was serious in the object of her journey      969.996957281762
 whatever he might afterwards persuade her to it was not on her side a scheme of infamy      642.209642530623
 my poor father      553.6385512922801
 how he must have felt it      132.77524072035618
 i never saw any one so shocked      409.89435694249676
 he could not speak a word for full ten minutes      152.4533622711289
 my mother was taken ill immediately and the whole house in such confusion      771.5894352325598
 jane cried elizabeth was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day      588.6264376774282
 i do not know      45.693014538637115
i hope there was      45.693014538637115
but to be guarded at such a time is very difficult      1267.6333043210827
 my mother was in hysterics and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done      659.421700120276
 but the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties      344.6535336432692
 your attendance upon her has been too much for you      400.1452849507138
 you do not look well      40.119101978691035
 that i had been with you you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone      489.73500265662085
 mary and kitty have been very kind and would have shared in every fatigue i am sure but i did not think it right for either of them      400.4159315125667
 kitty is slight and delicate and mary studies so much that her hours of repose should not be broken in on      282.68333350620316
 my aunt philips came to longbourn on tuesday after my father went away and was so good as to stay till thursday with me      752.0788587823204
 she was of great use and comfort to us all and lady lucas has been very kind she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us and offered her services or any of her daughters if they could be of use to us      554.4485856939583
 she had better have stayed at home cried elizabeth perhaps she meant well but under such a misfortune as this one cannot see too little of ones neighbours      936.6549265197616
 assistance is impossible condolence insufferable      1557.2653998760852
 let them triumph over us at a distance and be satisfied      2435.018753851331
 she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue while in town for the recovery of his daughter      1302.4024823435589
 he meant i believe replied jane to go to epsom the place where they last changed horses see the postilions and try if any thing could be made out from them      708.4937852425757
 his principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham      370.01358175576047
 it had come with a fare from london and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and ladys removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make enquiries at clapham      335.9289170678147
 i do not know of any other designs that he had formed but he was in such a hurry to be gone and his spirits so greatly discomposed that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this      279.3175416009687
 chapter vi      620.1082954481221
 the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr      619.6102706533213
 bennet the next morning but the post came in without bringing a single line from him      2758.2096028312208
 his family knew him to be on all common occasions a most negligent and dilatory correspondent but at such a time they had hoped for exertion      612.9793385332493
 gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off      92.2442422091142
 when he was gone they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on and their uncle promised at parting to prevail on mr      844.0612939056275
 bennet to return to longbourn as soon as he could to the great consolation of his sister who considered it as the only security for her husbands not being killed in a duel      410.3636235302852
 gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces      189.76094560149582
 she shared in their attendance on mrs      1428.6093873842615
 their other aunt also visited them frequently and always as she said with the design of cheering and heartening them up though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickhams extravagance or irregularity she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them      519.133038559324
 all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who but three months before had been almost an angel of light      972.2854648472706
 he was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place and his intrigues all honoured with the title of seduction had been extended into every tradesmans family      883.2344505867553
 every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world and every body began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness      501.80327966844607
 elizabeth though she did not credit above half of what was said believed enough to make her former assurance of her sisters ruin still more certain and even jane who believed still less of it became almost hopeless more especially as the time was now come when if they had gone to scotland which she had never before entirely despaired of they must in all probability have gained some news of them      544.4662297951863
 gardiner left longbourn on sunday on tuesday his wife received a letter from him it told them that on his arrival he had immediately found out his brother and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street      150.86434231920788
 bennet had been to epsom and clapham before his arrival but without gaining any satisfactory information and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town as mr      862.7006199709512
 bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them on their first coming to london before they procured lodgings      907.4623145912318
 gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure but as his brother was eager in it he meant to assist him in pursuing it      253.77670595046104
 he added that mr      287.24835050978845
 bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave london and promised to write again very soon      5269.903698971286
 there was also a postscript to this effect      1729.4435253892393
 i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out if possible from some of the young mans intimates in the regiment whether wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself      600.9959119325509
 if there were any one that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that it might be of essential consequence      568.144650848711
 at present we have nothing to guide us      2074.991148928952
 colonel forster will i dare say do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head      660.381358818547
 but on second thoughts perhaps lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any other person      364.8527949304309
 elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved      634.0076578220146
 she had never heard of his having had any relations except a father and mother both of whom had been dead many years      321.3527880409521
 it was possible however that some of his companions in the shire might be able to give more information and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it the application was a something to look forward to      1368.447019903667
 every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected      163.62016412991827
 the arrival of letters was the first grand object of every mornings impatience      149.53027266430865
 through letters whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance      767.4371867360358
 but before they heard again from mr      3269.027341569461
 gardiner a letter arrived for their father from a different quarter from mr      86.0671008422106
 collins which as jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence she accordingly read and elizabeth who knew what curiosities his letters always were looked over her and read it likewise      313.6920528885479
 be assured my dear sir that mrs      4444.614624194301
 collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family in your present distress which must be of the bitterest kind because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove      664.9620513320556
 no arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune or that may comfort you under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parents mind      404.284731740924
 the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this      569.4016940567348
 and it is the more to be lamented because there is reason to suppose as my dear charlotte informs me that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence though at the same time for the consolation of yourself and mrs      1227.6773255062421
 bennet i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad or she could not be guilty of such an enormity at so early an age      436.6946097624061
 howsoever that may be you are grievously to be pitied in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs      635.7728405384146
 collins but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter to whom i have related the affair      263.8880989888636
 they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others for who as lady catherine herself condescendingly says will connect themselves with such a family      598.1953974530959
 and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last november for had it been otherwise i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace      545.9422221781386
 let me advise you then my dear sir to console yourself as much as possible to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence      506.60705124097393
 i am dear sir c      250.52146603727175
 gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from colonel forster and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send      199.25146707845764
 it was not known that wickham had a single relation with whom he kept up any connection and it was certain that he had no near one living      437.18316267591706
 his former acquaintance had been numerous but since he had been in the militia it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them      394.29970275388956
 there was no one therefore who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him      555.8255235055734
 and in the wretched state of his own finances there was a very powerful motive for secrecy in addition to his fear of discovery by lydias relations for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount      673.4285968691966
 colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at brighton      686.3074198516202
 he owed a good deal in the town but his debts of honour were still more formidable      161.66923370261958
 gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family jane heard them with horror      108.15846795457621
 a gamester      50.29742447128457
 she cried      2056.6665453882724
 i had not an idea of it      48.199563998586285
 gardiner added in his letter that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day which was saturday      135.09810522432835
 rendered spiritless by the illsuccess of all their endeavours he had yielded to his brotherinlaws intreaty that he would return to his family and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit      1465.9288928056503
 when mrs      1454.2828608835578
 bennet was told of this she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected considering what her anxiety for his life had been before      1050.8280986122338
 she cried      2056.6665453882724
 sure he will not leave london before he has found them      728.581907603653
 who is to fight wickham and make him marry her if he comes away      347.7309667424879
 as mrs      50.29742447128457
 gardiner began to wish to be at home it was settled that she and her children should go to london at the same time that mr      349.76346499196876
 the coach therefore took them the first stage of their journey and brought its master back to longbourn      898.733655303042
 gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world      234.64946558884515
 his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece and the kind of halfexpectation which mrs      368.0630379375377
 gardiner had formed of their being followed by a letter from him had ended in nothing      110.33784926613245
 elizabeth had received none since her return that could come from pemberley      581.6040686906538
 the present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary nothing therefore could be fairly conjectured from that though elizabeth who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings was perfectly aware that had she known nothing of darcy she could have borne the dread of lydias infamy somewhat better      854.2525126222571
 it would have spared her she thought one sleepless night out of two      133.67375015901717
 bennet arrived he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure      575.5981120237321
 he said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying made no mention of the business that had taken him away and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it      625.9941655469528
 it was not till the afternoon when he joined them at tea that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject and then on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured he replied say nothing of that      510.0339197550682
 who should suffer but myself      168.68259607116462
 it has been my own doing and i ought to feel it      1187.6324326164536
 you must not be too severe upon yourself replied elizabeth      425.8325071886167
 human nature is so prone to fall into it      110.15461274490968
 no lizzy let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame      284.16319078757726
 i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression      205.56899392350272
 it will pass away soon enough      511.915545581368
 do you suppose them to be in london      40.11910197869102
 yes where else can they be so well concealed      1327.9590928053851
 and lydia used to want to go to london added kitty      48.33172745011818
 she is happy then said her father drily and her residence there will probably be of some duration      957.0192993281455
 then after a short silence he continued lizzy i bear you no illwill for being justified in your advice to me last may which considering the event shews some greatness of mind      839.5370102969664
 they were interrupted by miss bennet who came to fetch her mothers tea      775.6460883677179
 this is a parade cried he which does one good it gives such an elegance to misfortune      515.2051175805775
 another day i will do the same i will sit in my library in my night cap and powdering gown and give as much trouble as i canor perhaps i may defer it till kitty runs away      289.789488522902
 i am not going to run away papa said kitty fretfully if i should ever go to brighton i would behave better than lydia      111.31695715664516
 you go to brighton      40.11910197869102
i would not trust you so near it as east bourne for fifty pounds      193.98319050056074
 no kitty i have at last learnt to be cautious and you will feel the effects of it      156.42207191903623
 no officer is ever to enter my house again nor even to pass through the village      602.9983153872603
 and you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner      260.09761722974054
 kitty who took all these threats in a serious light began to cry      380.4549114410325
 well well said he do not make yourself unhappy      1138.3849417824417
 chapter vii      620.1082954481221
 two days after mr      1454.2828608835578
 bennets return as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house they saw the housekeeper coming towards them and concluding that she came to call them to their mother went forward to meet her but instead of the expected summons when they approached her she said to miss bennet i beg your pardon madam for interrupting you but i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town so i took the liberty of coming to ask      625.9393409741281
 we have heard nothing from town      531.8463367350109
 dear madam cried mrs      321.6287148705544
 hill in great astonishment dont you know there is an express come for master from mr      118.37341519977153
 he has been here this half hour and master has had a letter      927.416289511457
 they ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room from thence to the librarytheir father was in neither and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother when they were met by the butler who said if you are looking for my master maam he is walking towards the little copse      562.4330086734852
 upon this information they instantly passed through the hall once more and ran across the lawn after their father who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock      475.4536544816192
 what news      1454.2828608835578
 have you heard from my uncle      169.27659545907346
 yes i have had a letter from him by express      236.13676515832304
 well and what news does it bring      367.6531739013711
 good or bad      40.11910197869101
 what is there of good to be expected      758.8983923932333
 said he taking the letter from his pocket but perhaps you would like to read it      206.1870459848803
 elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand      457.17126674288704
 jane now came up      48.56388609578208
 read it aloud said their father for i hardly know myself what it is about      125.4715902357057
 gracechurchstreet monday august       40.11910197869101
 my dear brother at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece and such as upon the whole i hope will give you satisfaction      406.93518738098555
 soon after you left me on saturday i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of london they were      476.56848474611655
 the particulars i reserve till we meet      1132.2862363621482
 elizabeth read on i have seen them both      902.4873677981599
 they are not married nor can i find there was any intention of being so but if you are willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on your side i hope it will not be long before they are      285.48463937088326
 all that is required of you is to assure to your daughter by settlement her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister and moreover to enter into an engagement of allowing her during your life one hundred pounds per annum      260.0242004334948
 these are conditions which considering every thing i had no hesitation in complying with as far as i thought myself privileged for you      826.3788142649564
 i shall send this by express that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer      294.172801041119
 you will easily comprehend from these particulars that mr      94.40006465262863
 wickhams circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be      658.677276319794
 the world has been deceived in that respect and i am happy to say there will be some little money even when all his debts are discharged to settle on my niece in addition to her own fortune      564.1734139880803
 if as i conclude will be the case you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business i will immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper settlement      587.8767434684792
 there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again therefore stay quietly at longbourn and depend on my diligence and care      1204.7655481489764
 send back your answer as soon as you can and be careful to write explicitly      307.6217566346832
 we have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house of which i hope you will approve      550.9608867838854
 she comes to us today      1074.9972338701825
 i shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on      268.92710540905745
 yours c      40.11910197869102
 edw      40.11910197869102
 cried elizabeth when she had finished      404.8802705831523
 wickham is not so undeserving then as we have thought him said her sister      364.74575104397917
 my dear father i congratulate you      553.6385512922801
 and have you answered the letter      45.567935788034156
 said elizabeth      2056.6665453882724
 no but it must be done soon      344.6535336432692
 most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote      1664.5606840052878
 my dear father she cried come back and write immediately      391.3151863312506
 consider how important every moment is in such a case      378.27007511442713
 let me write for you said jane if you dislike the trouble yourself      2469.4694765755266
 i dislike it very much he replied but it must be done      185.86516353280456
 and so saying he turned back with them and walked towards the house      175.46786254527686
 and may i ask      48.563886095782074
 said elizabeth but the terms i suppose must be complied with      219.57311607903432
 complied with      620.1082954481221
 i am only ashamed of his asking so little      110.99212611339226
 and they must marry      48.563886095782074
 yet he is such a man      493.23587565936685
 yes yes they must marry      1074.9972338701825
 but there are two things that i want very much to knowone is how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about and the other how i am ever to pay him      709.217831201568
 money      40.11910197869102
 my uncle      2056.6665453882724
 cried jane what do you mean sir      291.00574026113895
 i mean that no man in his senses would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred ayear during my life and fifty after i am gone      402.16480643123475
 that is very true said elizabeth though it had not occurred to me before      396.94545288125624
 it must be my uncles doings      537.9233496542191
 generous good man i am afraid he has distressed himself      456.39598069005467
 a small sum could not do all this      379.18270596351107
 no said her father wickhams a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds      326.054822086311
 i should be sorry to think so ill of him in the very beginning of our relationship      286.20552871980266
 ten thousand pounds      6063.984910895558
 heaven forbid      40.11910197869102
 how is half such a sum to be repaid      244.55606762089144
 bennet made no answer and each of them deep in thought continued silent till they reached the house      579.9286125097955
 and they are really to be married      124.8164466359274
 cried elizabeth as soon as they were by themselves      449.3932216753387
 how strange this is      241.5461082312236
 and for this we are to be thankful      96.58601256237245
 that they should marry small as is their chance of happiness and wretched as is his character we are forced to rejoice      345.76260499920585
 oh lydia      40.11910197869102
 i comfort myself with thinking replied jane that he certainly would not marry lydia if he had not a real regard for her      949.6467002150408
 though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds or any thing like it has been advanced      94.82103251641142
 he has children of his own and may have more      387.603271516976
 how could he spare half ten thousand pounds      195.1887165389063
 if we are ever able to learn what wickhams debts have been said elizabeth and how much is settled on his side on our sister we shall exactly know what mr      637.5171221260741
 gardiner has done for them because wickham has not sixpence of his own      157.7194590133637
 the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited      338.1854251022961
 their taking her home and affording her their personal protection and countenance is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge      258.37494093934606
 by this time she is actually with them      752.1964302304341
 if such goodness does not make her miserable now she will never deserve to be happy      394.5940089173005
 we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side said jane i hope and trust they will yet be happy      793.098570370235
 his consenting to marry her is a proof i will believe that he is come to a right way of thinking      530.2874342670156
 their conduct has been such replied elizabeth as neither you nor i nor any body can ever forget      421.75432499134394
 it is useless to talk of it      441.5265848586887
 it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened      345.1246707406102
 he was writing and without raising his head coolly replied just as you please      688.0660068171243
 take whatever you like and get away      1072.26800372346
 elizabeth took the letter from his writing table and they went up stairs together      662.9604843851874
 mary and kitty were both with mrs      147.00485690624024
 bennet one communication would therefore do for all      1885.9715376448294
 after a slight preparation for good news the letter was read aloud      568.3446413157826
 as soon as jane had read mr      517.3715919262704
 gardiners hope of lydias being soon married her joy burst forth and every following sentence added to its exuberance      324.83930983897096
 she was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation      324.59141777610887
 to know that her daughter would be married was enough      345.8834744103378
 my dear dear lydia      287.24835050978845
 she cried this is delightful indeed      1547.9969552007517
she will be married      2445.8024889638004
i shall see her again      270.37029714614835
she will be married at sixteen      2196.9161006306235
my good kind brother      287.24835050978845
i knew how it would bei knew he would manage every thing      276.21263489802595
 how i long to see her      141.82953710106122
 and to see dear wickham too      150.80830190564933
 but the clothes the wedding clothes      1632.3773188485725
 stay stay i will go myself      628.8317711714146
 ring the bell kitty for hill      43.75391731724056
 i will put on my things in a moment      239.906026399863
 my dear dear lydia      287.24835050978845
how merry we shall be together when we meet      512.5999343888922
 gardiners behaviour laid them all under      48.67533438014639
 for we must attribute this happy conclusion she added in a great measure to his kindness      1713.0722948360033
 well cried her mother it is all very right who should do it but her own uncle      555.3995854218335
 if he had not had a family of his own i and my children must have had all his money you know and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him except a few presents      191.31969822634423
 i am so happy      51.161949297677936
 in a short time i shall have a daughter married      107.44867724559711
 how well it sounds      241.5461082312236
 and she was only sixteen last june      152.15295271847975
 we will settle with your father about the money afterwards but the things should be ordered immediately      2270.932904606586
 she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico muslin and cambric and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders had not jane though with some difficulty persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted      740.3524015633931
 one days delay she observed would be of small importance and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual      500.19540357300406
 other schemes too came into her head      344.6535336432692
 i will go to meryton said she as soon as i am dressed and tell the good good news to my sister philips      299.0985392263363
 long      40.11910197869102
 kitty run down and order the carriage      336.2508332279449
 girls can i do any thing for you in meryton      185.79085828812782
 here comes hill      553.6385512922801
 my dear hill have you heard the good news      251.26965977195474
 miss lydia is going to be married and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding      291.12472187273306
 hill began instantly to express her joy      133.09263722779298
 elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest and then sick of this folly took refuge in her own room that she might think with freedom      807.6110343045376
 poor lydias situation must at best be bad enough but that it was no worse she had need to be thankful      302.9962789150689
 she felt it so and though in looking forward neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister in looking back to what they had feared only two hours ago she felt all the advantages of what they had gained      232.04755276366575
 chapter viii      620.1082954481221
 had he done his duty in that respect lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her      213.0939717742332
 the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place      901.604345727854
 he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to any one should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brotherinlaw and he was determined if possible to find out the extent of his assistance and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could      602.1778970039513
 when first mr      439.4232093657577
 bennet had married economy was held to be perfectly useless for of course they were to have a son      517.8632834432817
 this son was to join in cutting off the entail as soon as he should be of age and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for      382.82160157258994
 bennet for many years after lydias birth had been certain that he would      1272.6727769099311
 this event had at last been despaired of but it was then too late to be saving      432.2971129317267
 bennet had no turn for economy and her husbands love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income      308.3407883019859
 five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs      356.3184041682202
 bennet and the children      2056.6665453882724
 but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents      529.7194928333261
 this was one point with regard to lydia at least which was now to be settled and mr      612.0302200127624
 in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother though expressed most concisely he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him      599.187728423711
 he had never before supposed that could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement      952.8677849085461
 he would scarcely be ten pounds ayear the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them for what with her board and pocket allowance and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mothers hands lydias expences had been very little within that sum      585.5490696048759
 that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side too was another very welcome surprise for his chief wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible      520.9911311388533
 when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over he naturally returned to all his former indolence      993.6398330807367
 his letter was soon dispatched for though dilatory in undertaking business he was quick in its execution      1689.2476943676804
 he begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother but was too angry with lydia to send any message to her      547.2848197819563
 the good news quickly spread through the house and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood      528.6371223025603
 it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy      1418.141328129121
 to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had miss lydia bennet come upon the town or as the happiest alternative been secluded from the world in some distant farm house      687.0489444916072
 but there was much to be talked of in marrying her and the goodnatured wishes for her welldoing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances because with such an husband her misery was considered certain      517.4571834319968
 it was a fortnight since mrs      516.7497138521829
 bennet had been down stairs but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table and in spirits oppressively high      846.3964947335892
 the marriage of a daughter which had been the first object of her wishes since jane was sixteen was now on the point of accomplishment and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials fine muslins new carriages and servants      373.87491252978396
 she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter and without knowing or considering what their income might be rejected many as deficient in size and importance      493.31030862543787
 i could not bear to have her ten miles from me and as for purvis lodge the attics are dreadful      253.49948240258075
 her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained      276.17127845211536
 but when they had withdrawn he said to her mrs      814.6955581649441
 bennet before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter let us come to a right understanding      908.3122374816768
 into one house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance      165.30266447272706
 i will not encourage the impudence of either by receiving them at longbourn      240.4094773513949
 a long dispute followed this declaration but mr      44.13999885317416
 bennet was firm it soon led to another and mrs      1873.2545379582555
 he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion      1885.9715376448291
 bennet could hardly comprehend it      935.8394474874626
 that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid exceeded all that she could believe possible      350.7803954229669
 she was more alive to the disgrace which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughters nuptials than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham a fortnight before they took place      734.4788728506282
 elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had from the distress of the moment been led to make mr      967.3484965800342
 darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot      371.345273984388
 she had no fear of its spreading farther through his means      191.70600424885794
 there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sisters frailty would have mortified her so much      2373.9715614114366
 not however from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself for at any rate there seemed a gulf impassable between them      372.888027778532
 had lydias marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms it was not to be supposed that mr      123.41348462032632
 darcy would connect himself with a family where to every other objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned      578.7762547199571
 from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink      436.16186353883717
 the wish of procuring her regard which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this      361.1658876220417
 she was humbled she was grieved she repented though she hardly knew of what      1300.500626588967
 she became jealous of his esteem when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it      1614.6446930576233
 she wanted to hear of him when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence      897.8158658397588
 she was convinced that she could have been happy with him when it was no longer likely they should meet      785.1529131086052
 what a triumph for him as she often thought could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now have been gladly and gratefully received      485.25454993256466
 he was as generous she doubted not as the most generous of his sex      782.6275021845352
 but while he was mortal there must be a triumph      858.2124126154156
 she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who in disposition and talents would most suit her      561.9418685549967
 his understanding and temper though unlike her own would have answered all her wishes      438.2633120266974
 it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both by her ease and liveliness his mind might have been softened his manners improved and from his judgment information and knowledge of the world she must have received benefit of greater importance      567.1326185841986
 but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was      424.2654269081945
 an union of a different tendency and precluding the possibility of the other was soon to be formed in their family      161.42972046948572
 how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she could not imagine      291.74310784122486
 but how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue she could easily conjecture      1023.5506423242597
 mr      40.11910197869102
 gardiner soon wrote again to his brother      48.199563998586285
 to mr      1454.2828608835578
 bennets acknowledgments he briefly replied with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again      1645.8692739077826
 the principal purport of his letter was to inform them that mr      899.4816034400608
 it was greatly my wish that he should do so he added as soon as his marriage was fixed on      630.3041886300858
 and i think you will agree with me in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable both on his account and my nieces      80.63174845671713
 it is mr      522.6542288787506
 wickhams intention to go into the regulars and among his former friends there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army      387.54614715418825
 he has the promise of an ensigncy in general s regiment now quartered in the north      806.2157362282456
 i have written to colonel forster to inform him of our present arrangements and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of mr      435.67668857344944
 wickham in and near brighton with assurances of speedy payment for which i have pledged myself      169.96518019667482
 and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton of whom i shall subjoin a list according to his information      173.68343902604923
 he has given in all his debts i hope at least he has not deceived us      205.2745903804355
 gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the south      299.38811800727507
 she is well and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother      752.1740893360725
yours c      40.11910197869102
 e      40.11910197869102
 bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickhams removal from the shire as clearly as mr      393.6850642317601
 gardiner could do      46.64598115839911
 but mrs      2056.6665453882724
 bennet was not so well pleased with it      1885.9715376448294
 lydias being settled in the north just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire was a severe disappointment and besides it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body and had so many favourites      836.1199117091293
 forster said she it will be quite shocking to send her away      1088.9609503413817
 and there are several of the young men too that she likes very much      403.9167524033563
 his daughters request for such it might be considered of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the north received at first an absolute negative      628.6756145870968
 but jane and elizabeth who agreed in wishing for the sake of their sisters feelings and consequence that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly to receive her and her husband at longbourn as soon as they were married that he was prevailed on to think as they thought and act as they wished      423.5730080880795
 and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the north      395.9802246175025
 bennet wrote again to his brother therefore he sent his permission for them to come and it was settled that as soon as the ceremony was over they should proceed to longbourn      597.1506105646084
 chapter ix      620.1082954481221
 their sisters wedding day arrived and jane and elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself      1765.8858643433816
 the carriage was sent to meet them at and they were to return in it by dinnertime      610.18212007732
 their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets and jane more especially who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself had she been the culprit was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure      396.3225000567518
 they came      1454.2828608835578
 the family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive them      640.7008128492622
 smiles decked the face of mrs      2517.6843954461397
 bennet as the carriage drove up to the door her husband looked impenetrably grave her daughters alarmed anxious uneasy      1017.3516641544261
 lydias voice was heard in the vestibule the door was thrown open and she ran into the room      375.05803180152947
 her mother stepped forwards embraced her and welcomed her with rapture gave her hand with an affectionate smile to wickham who followed his lady and wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness      1400.6006456624104
 their reception from mr      1729.4435253892393
 bennet to whom they then turned was not quite so cordial      1267.6333043210827
 his countenance rather gained in austerity and he scarcely opened his lips      473.4525598753088
 the easy assurance of the young couple indeed was enough to provoke him      1802.3937136311783
 elizabeth was disgusted and even miss bennet was shocked      1418.141328129121
 lydia was lydia still untamed unabashed wild noisy and fearless      221.8924379574534
 she turned from sister to sister demanding their congratulations and when at length they all sat down looked eagerly round the room took notice of some little alteration in it and observed with a laugh that it was a great while since she had been there      887.6123758216642
 wickham was not at all more distressed than herself but his manners were always so pleasing that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought his smiles and his easy address while he claimed their relationship would have delighted them all      720.2490851718783
 elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance but she sat down resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man      833.8699683976988
 she blushed and jane blushed but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour      332.31154874430877
 there was no want of discourse      1832.2815889285312
 they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world      2784.119909743617
 nothing of the past was recollected with pain and lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world      657.6015432607032
 good gracious      40.11910197869102
 when i went away i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came back again      421.51899191367374
 though i thought it would be very good fun if i was      138.65960756422848
 her father lifted up his eyes      423.3809595186248
 jane was distressed      46.64598115839911
 elizabeth looked expressively at lydia but she who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible gaily continued oh      1044.757764836236
 mamma do the people here abouts know i am married today      758.2652220802573
 i was afraid they might not and we overtook william goulding in his curricle so i was determined he should know it and so i let down the side glass next to him and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the window frame so that he might see the ring and then i bowed and smiled like any thing      230.61901870772283
 elizabeth could bear it no longer      175.26129507828713
 she got up and ran out of the room and returned no more till she heard them passing through the hall to the diningparlour      214.23198564638443
 she then joined them soon enough to see lydia with anxious parade walk up to her mothers right hand and hear her say to her eldest sister ah      680.3262130277068
 jane i take your place now and you must go lower because i am a married woman      174.35792592895586
 it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first      1225.2434106517437
 her ease and good spirits increased      553.6385512922801
 she longed to see mrs      1074.9972338701825
 philips the lucases and all their other neighbours and to hear herself called mrs      719.3345061839071
 wickham by each of them and in the mean time she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married to mrs      743.7661745423223
 hill and the two housemaids      44.519480662564156
 is not he a charming man      182.44256433244362
 i am sure my sisters must all envy me      287.54003505248056
 i only hope they may have half my good luck      42.26205845365054
 what a pity it is mamma we did not all go      700.8633646917768
 must it be so      2056.6665453882724
 oh lord      40.11910197869102
 yesthere is nothing in that      4519.874953204515
 i shall like it of all things      163.89484864115948
 you and papa and my sisters must come down and see us      169.27659545907346
 we shall be at newcastle all the winter and i dare say there will be some balls and i will take care to get good partners for them all      1017.3492659402648
 i should like it beyond any thing      146.94618511039909
 and then when you go away you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over      176.77475013021356
 i thank you for my share of the favour said elizabeth but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands      165.45748579822774
 their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them      391.4652770829217
 wickham had received his commission before he left london and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight      430.30025710401446
 no one but mrs      40.11910197869102
 bennet regretted that their stay would be so short and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter and having very frequent parties at home      1437.3586626507329
 wickhams affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expected to find it not equal to lydias for him      1210.1921686266708
 she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied from the reason of things that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather than by his and she would have wondered why without violently caring for her he chose to elope with her at all had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances and if that were the case he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion      948.7144312360872
 lydia was exceedingly fond of him      47.178970126357285
 he was her dear wickham on every occasion no one was to be put in competition with him      579.9286125097955
 he did every thing best in the world and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of september than any body else in the country      464.76379706967157
 one morning soon after their arrival as she was sitting with her two elder sisters she said to elizabeth lizzy i never gave you an account of my wedding i believe      305.63094500870085
 you were not by when i told mamma and the others all about it      344.6535336432692
 no really replied elizabeth i think there cannot be too little said on the subject      203.89169505174058
 la      40.11910197869102
 you are so strange      40.11910197869102
 but i must tell you how it went off      543.1115498152591
 we were married you know at st      2960.83542238519
 clements because wickhams lodgings were in that parish      3739.5058650810784
 and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven oclock      502.1405970281389
 my uncle and aunt and i were to go together and the others were to meet us at the church      183.29874320328994
 i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off and then i should have gone quite distracted      187.4175082746447
 however i did not hear above one word in ten for i was thinking you may suppose of my dear wickham      257.27730244493796
 well and so we breakfasted at ten as usual i thought it would never be over for by the bye you are to understand that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them      846.791940321164
 if youll believe me i did not once put my foot out of doors though i was there a fortnight      613.5797561090249
 not one party or scheme or any thing      263.40789882134857
 to be sure london was rather thin but however the little theatre was open      667.799323868955
 well and so just as the carriage came to the door my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man mr      470.9373928746275
 stone      40.11910197869102
 and then you know when once they get together there is no end of it      115.17437015817539
 but luckily he came back again in ten minutes time and then we all set out      244.61370062028237
 however i recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going the wedding need not be put off for mr      705.1131288345823
 darcy might have done as well      113.50930596523533
 repeated elizabeth in utter amazement      4519.874953204515
 but gracious me      553.6385512922801
 i quite forgot      47.71804916323267
 i ought not to have said a word about it      86.65830354848481
 i promised them so faithfully      215.01817017506332
 it was to be such a secret      1155.0167054475457
 if it was to be secret said jane say not another word on the subject      864.4141477941333
 you may depend upon my seeking no further      118.1096785846048
 certainly said elizabeth though burning with curiosity we will ask you no questions      429.98605574970253
 on such encouragement to ask elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power by running away      296.95919546398176
 but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible or at least it was impossible not to try for information      172.7742851539285
 darcy had been at her sisters wedding      97.83758319273011
 it was exactly a scene and exactly among people where he had apparently least to do and least temptation to go      1424.5502799414066
 conjectures as to the meaning of it rapid and wild hurried into her brain but she was satisfied with none      1095.4291487405817
 those that best pleased her as placing his conduct in the noblest light seemed most improbable      3235.953531156827
 she could not bear such suspense and hastily seizing a sheet of paper wrote a short letter to her aunt to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended      630.6023978174777
 you may readily comprehend she added what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us and comparatively speaking a stranger to our family should have been amongst you at such a time      328.0312400528862
 pray write instantly and let me understand itunless it is for very cogent reasons to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance      484.22291125829685
 not that i shall though she added to herself as she finished the letter and my dear aunt if you do not tell me in an honourable manner i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out      278.72329754482615
 janes delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall elizabeth was glad of ittill it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction she had rather be without a confidante      464.38116838424827
 chapter x      620.1082954481221
 elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could      422.7103809747278
 she was no sooner in possession of it than hurrying into the little copse where she was least likely to be interrupted she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial      467.3189412442273
       1.0
 my dear niece i have just received your letter and shall devote this whole morning to answering it as i foresee that a little writing will not comprise what i have to tell you      614.4416085664262
 i must confess myself surprised by your application i did not expect it from you      2219.53592186957
 dont think me angry however for i only mean to let you know that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side      239.45108007479246
 if you do not choose to understand me forgive my impertinence      74.34100992092196
 your uncle is as much surprised as i amand nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done      339.76642269341755
 on the very day of my coming home from longbourn your uncle had a most unexpected visitor      161.66923370261958
 darcy called and was shut up with him several hours      139.75505364770575
 it was all over before i arrived so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as yours seems to have been      546.9826790326248
 he came to tell mr      579.3257207032427
 gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr      177.19356137798653
 wickham were and that he had seen and talked with them both wickham repeatedly lydia once      689.6054538850524
 from what i can collect he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them      531.9301893575279
 the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickhams worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him      1233.325365665657
 he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world      857.7180297668982
 his character was to speak for itself      321.29638624120867
 he called it therefore his duty to step forward and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself      583.0879842557079
 if he had another motive i am sure it would never disgrace him      139.3536522287959
 he had been some days in town before he was able to discover them but he had something to direct his search which was more than we had and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us      800.6436281098511
 there is a lady it seems a mrs      740.5751839787724
 younge who was some time ago governess to miss darcy and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation though he did not say what      770.3079679493513
 she then took a large house in edwardstreet and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings      462.85405384843534
 younge was he knew intimately acquainted with wickham and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town      403.7029939710074
 at length however our kind friend procured the wishedfor direction      400.1452849507138
 he saw wickham and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia      1338.4711704261013
 but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was      570.0884517089722
 she cared for none of her friends she wanted no help of his she would not hear of leaving wickham      374.8561345880957
 since such were her feelings it only remained he thought to secure and expedite a marriage which in his very first conversation with wickham he easily learnt had never been his design      1104.3369627230354
 he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour which were very pressing and scrupled not to lay all the illconsequences of lydias flight on her own folly alone      1069.8561586814758
 he must go somewhere but he did not know where and he knew he should have nothing to live on      1387.3390658026285
 darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once      283.05367968554714
 though mr      1454.2828608835578
 bennet was not imagined to be very rich he would have been able to do something for him and his situation must have been benefited by marriage      754.6630156114073
 but he found in reply to this question that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country      303.8589606058114
 under such circumstances however he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief      285.9891950428056
 they met several times for there was much to be discussed      2593.395026408562
 wickham of course wanted more than he could get but at length was reduced to be reasonable      458.9356551409289
 every thing being settled between them mr      380.52835234615804
 darcys next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it and he first called in gracechurchstreet the evening before i came home      2173.9491772321103
 but mr      2056.6665453882724
 gardiner could not be seen and mr      48.199563998586285
 darcy found on further enquiry that your father was still with him but would quit town the next morning      107.73872973131175
 he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former      208.33511695327638
 he did not leave his name and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business      260.71605445663363
 on saturday he came again      193.76542062357612
 your father was gone your uncle at home and as i said before they had a great deal of talk together      366.7521188082588
 they met again on sunday and then i saw him too      1320.8308204188343
 it was not all settled before monday as soon as it was the express was sent off to longbourn      755.7039961372815
 but our visitor was very obstinate      493.23587565936685
 i fancy lizzy that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all      105.57130836477069
 he has been accused of many faults at different times but this is the true one      1070.4310594288131
 nothing was to be done that he did not do himself though i am sure and i do not speak it to be thanked therefore say nothing about it your uncle would most readily have settled the whole      316.9023225618035
 they battled it together for a long time which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved      1056.3189955674463
 but at last your uncle was forced to yield and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it which went sorely against the grain and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers and give the praise where it was due      403.93358271800287
 but lizzy this must go no farther than yourself or jane at most      230.97628785853752
 you know pretty well i suppose what has been done for the young people      344.65353364326927
 his debts are to be paid amounting i believe to considerably more than a thousand pounds another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her and his commission purchased      804.3869615313791
 the reason why all this was to be done by him alone was such as i have given above      332.92038998476755
 it was owing to him to his reserve and want of proper consideration that wickhams character had been so misunderstood and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was      629.0028725373855
 perhaps there was some truth in this though i doubt whether his reserve or anybodys reserve can be answerable for the event      2275.1767888516583
 but in spite of all this fine talking my dear lizzy you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair      544.4929268153929
 when all this was resolved on he returned again to his friends who were still staying at pemberley but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place and all money matters were then to receive the last finish      392.68788846461405
 i believe i have now told you every thing      621.5088372110616
 it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure      263.65147474981546
 lydia came to us and wickham had constant admission to the house      279.00747664813616
 he was exactly what he had been when i knew him in hertfordshire but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us if i had not perceived by janes letter last wednesday that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it and therefore what i now tell you can give you no fresh pain      614.2533011198416
 i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family      400.8700599829362
 if she heard me it was by good luck for i am sure she did not listen      660.2127084921876
 i was sometimes quite provoked but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane and for their sakes had patience with her      2285.942740088209
 he dined with us the next day and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday      398.3782823275305
 will you be very angry with me my dear lizzy if i take this opportunity of saying what i was never bold enough to say before how much i like him      303.38096042069697
 his understanding and opinions all please me he wants nothing but a little more liveliness and that if he marry prudently his wife may teach him      209.92879440080185
 i thought him very slyhe hardly ever mentioned your name      177.69275441557818
 but slyness seems the fashion      814.6955581649441
 pray forgive me if i have been very presuming or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from p      282.0130878133651
 i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park      249.73313098474415
 a low phaeton with a nice little pair of ponies would be the very thing      330.6438800244852
 but i must write no more      526.8709402963223
 yours very sincerely m      40.11910197869102
 the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share      1887.1461248430064
 the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr      300.0485580533301
 darcy might have been doing to forward her sisters match which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable and at the same time dreaded to be just from the pain of obligation were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true      433.0364193296398
 he had followed them purposely to town he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise and where he was reduced to meet frequently meet reason with persuade and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to avoid and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce      475.31956932384435
 he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem      126.92517570492953
 her heart did whisper that he had done it for her      345.76260499920585
 brotherinlaw of wickham      553.6385512922801
 every kind of pride must revolt from the connection      241.19465281934845
 she was ashamed to think how much      1250.1453600446355
 but he had given a reason for his interference which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief      298.0632124348855
 it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong he had liberality and he had the means of exercising it and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement she could perhaps believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned      541.5591193198615
 it was painful exceedingly painful to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return      1461.9850602540182
 they owed the restoration of lydia her character every thing to him      897.2998697585803
 how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him      252.62980886527401
 for herself she was humbled but she was proud of him      646.6584695325105
 she read over her aunts commendation of him again and again      392.20285255752265
 it was hardly enough but it pleased her      827.5845652120538
 she was even sensible of some pleasure though mixed with regret on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between mr      2231.500530858325
 she was roused from her seat and her reflections by some ones approach and before she could strike into another path she was overtaken by wickham      846.5017070958091
 said he as he joined her      207.22126484587707
 you certainly do she replied with a smile but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome      191.41619659696045
 i should be sorry indeed if it were      124.93451255912733
 we were always good friends and now we are better      1873.2545379582555
 true      40.11910197869102
 are the others coming out      225.75951233528167
 i do not know      45.693014538637115
 bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to meryton      942.5040812538138
 and so my dear sister i find from our uncle and aunt that you have actually seen pemberley      277.4199516275714
 she replied in the affirmative      1074.9972338701825
 i almost envy you the pleasure and yet i believe it would be too much for me or else i could take it in my way to newcastle      529.1029100119885
 and you saw the old housekeeper i suppose      44.13999885317416
 but of course she did not mention my name to you      458.426992523804
 yes she did      553.6385512922801
 and what did she say      46.74347398462845
 that you were gone into the army and she was afraid hadnot turned out well      507.1583560079309
 at such a distance as that you know things are strangely misrepresented      267.16709736522
 certainly he replied biting his lips      1324.8242984663916
 elizabeth hoped she had silenced him but he soon afterwards said i was surprised to see darcy in town last month      856.3071992302894
 we passed each other several times      1975.7124309660671
 i wonder what he can be doing there      281.1111668884079
 perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh said elizabeth      1641.5753181325633
 it must be something particular to take him there at this time of year      2134.5500532388837
 undoubtedly      40.11910197869102
 did you see him while you were at lambton      42.507121423688325
 i thought i understood from the gardiners that you had      177.69275441557818
 yes he introduced us to his sister      1293.9253291434882
 and do you like her      46.74347398462845
 very much      40.11910197869102
 i have heard indeed that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two      143.02717444360943
 when i last saw her she was not very promising      199.2561009410794
 i am very glad you liked her      148.44344286524932
 i hope she will turn out well      409.89435694249676
 i dare say she will she has got over the most trying age      304.8523428054251
 did you go by the village of kympton      42.81544943112701
 i do not recollect that we did      43.215159672798116
 i mention it because it is the living which i ought to have had      385.30985200358293
 a most delightful place      347.71207448182764
excellent parsonage house      32870.41981562739
 it would have suited me in every respect      257.78007662665317
 exceedingly well      2056.6665453882724
 one ought not to repinebut to be sure it would have been such a thing for me      226.38413843862594
 the quiet the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness      697.2559698487859
 but it was not to be      526.8709402963223
 did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance when you were in kent      140.22698603321572
 i have heard from authority which i thought as good that it was left you conditionally only and at the will of the present patron      197.7597581963955
 you did      40.11910197869102
 and it was not wholly without foundation      134.4487390078635
 you may remember what i told you on that point when first we talked of it      1318.796712279527
 they were now almost at the door of the house for she had walked fast to get rid of him and unwilling for her sisters sake to provoke him she only said in reply with a goodhumoured smile come mr      691.3125002831429
 wickham we are brother and sister you know      613.2510446116415
 do not let us quarrel about the past      98.44091095009432
 in future i hope we shall be always of one mind      292.15421678989
 she held out her hand he kissed it with affectionate gallantry though he hardly knew how to look and they entered the house      229.70806027169436
 chapter xi      620.1082954481221
 wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again distressed himself or provoked his dear sister elizabeth by introducing the subject of it and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet      1363.9717417347256
 the day of his and lydias departure soon came and mrs      298.7000490284855
 bennet was forced to submit to a separation which as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth      1260.3096715281438
 my dear lydia she cried when shall we meet again      209.1515882498129
 oh lord      40.11910197869102
 i dont know      47.71804916323267
 write to me very often my dear      1035.5743332476811
 as often as i can      259.3295804444709
 but you know married women have never much time for writing      157.6648585937429
 my sisters may write to me      663.8157882572414
 they will have nothing else to do      961.3828248384349
 wickhams adieus were much more affectionate than his wifes      1086.4486766561884
 he smiled looked handsome and said many pretty things      1519.6478732850962
 bennet as soon as they were out of the house as ever i saw      1300.500626588967
 he simpers and smirks and makes love to us all      2322.0219798534795
 i defy even sir william lucas himself to produce a more valuable soninlaw      416.0647142702516
 the loss of her daughter made mrs      344.6535336432692
 bennet very dull for several days      2056.6665453882715
 i often think said she that there is nothing so bad as parting with ones friends      415.83310173218445
 one seems so forlorn without them      553.6385512922801
 this is the consequence you see madam of marrying a daughter said elizabeth      898.1732173664108
 it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single      1120.9757460543428
 it is no such thing      202.60430451798896
 lydia does not leave me because she is married but only because her husbands regiment happens to be so far off      288.34605621836334
 if that had been nearer she would not have gone so soon      265.4479641102706
 but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope by an article of news which then began to be in circulation      844.8437563659734
 the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master who was coming down in a day or two to shoot there for several weeks      1494.1819416888059
 bennet was quite in the fidgets      2056.6665453882715
 she looked at jane and smiled and shook her head by turns      304.3290262807038
 well well and so mr      814.6955581649441
 philips first brought her the news      173.62173424437103
 well so much the better      814.6955581649441
 not that i care about it though      312.16086139288547
 he is nothing to us you know and i am sure i never want to see him again      235.31767772191816
 and who knows what may happen      150.80830190564933
 but that is nothing to us      1632.3773188485725
 and so is it quite certain he is coming      118.23040598899796
 you may depend on it replied the other for mrs      95.16968476378769
 nicholls was in meryton last night i saw her passing by and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it and she told me that it was certain true      373.950674954382
 he comes down on thursday at the latest very likely on wednesday      925.759575528228
 miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour      2242.89263897834
 it was many months since she had mentioned his name to elizabeth but now as soon as they were alone together she said i saw you look at me today lizzy when my aunt told us of the present report and i know i appeared distressed      646.048511942141
 but dont imagine it was from any silly cause      474.60331677079944
 i am glad of one thing that he comes alone because we shall see the less of him      152.7159662210954
 elizabeth did not know what to make of it      1418.141328129121
 had she not seen him in derbyshire she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged but she still thought him partial to jane and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friends permission or being bold enough to come without it      642.2469487124787
 yet it is hard she sometimes thought that this poor man cannot come to a house which he has legally hired without raising all this speculation      902.2996249458531
 in spite of what her sister declared and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it      1090.6987437085184
 they were more disturbed more unequal than she had often seen them      1832.2815889285312
 the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents about a twelvemonth ago was now brought forward again      1045.2978788924615
 as soon as ever mr      1252.4982553609468
 bingley comes my dear said mrs      162.5378466980104
 no no      40.11910197869102
 but it ended in nothing and i will not be sent on a fools errand again      459.83781513852495
 his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen on his returning to netherfield      2310.345835412613
 tis an etiquette i despise said he      457.17126674288704
 if he wants our society let him seek it      477.580641476315
 he knows where we live      193.76542062357612
 i will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again      433.2980702493577
 well all i know is that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him      151.48936520389026
 but however that shant prevent my asking him to dine here i am determined      1010.1793854861706
 we must have mrs      1729.4435253892393
 long and the gouldings soon      40.119101978691035
 consoled by this resolution she was the better able to bear her husbands incivility though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see mr      492.28594039191626
 bingley in consequence of it before they did      306.5539012303626
 as the day of his arrival drew near i begin to be sorry that he comes at all said jane to her sister      245.4881724167662
 it would be nothing i could see him with perfect indifference but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of      217.25049431846486
 my mother means well but she does not know no one can know how much i suffer from what she says      1175.9057037015784
 happy shall i be when his stay at netherfield is over      420.41560823563583
 i wish i could say any thing to comfort you replied elizabeth but it is wholly out of my power      199.87098434832342
 you must feel it and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me because you have always so much      576.0678634602634
 bingley arrived      2056.6665453882724
 bennet through the assistance of servants contrived to have the earliest tidings of it that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could      1053.861254347734
 she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent hopeless of seeing him before      722.1484317452836
 but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire she saw him from her dressingroom window enter the paddock and ride towards the house      254.69313836237043
 her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy      95.16968476378769
 jane resolutely kept her place at the table but elizabeth to satisfy her mother went to the windowshe lookedshe saw mr      808.226701156478
 darcy with him and sat down again by her sister      331.64837859907277
 there is a gentleman with him mamma said kitty who can it be      499.4070266301071
 la      40.11910197869102
 whats his name      439.4232093657577
 that tall proud man      270.45643337730826
 good gracious      40.11910197869102
and so it does i vow      190.0065540698287
 well any friend of mr      814.6955581649441
 bingleys will always be welcome here to be sure but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him      386.09069327999066
 jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern      118.1096785846048
 both sisters were uncomfortable enough      814.6955581649441
 each felt for the other and of course for themselves and their mother talked on of her dislike of mr      685.0529787536019
 darcy and her resolution to be civil to him only as mr      71.91929341677493
 bingleys friend without being heard by either of them      586.5929186828645
 but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane to whom she had never yet had courage to shew mrs      530.1058000535496
 gardiners letter or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him      175.73632566154058
 to jane he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused and whose merit she had undervalued but to her own more extensive information he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits and whom she regarded herself with an interest if not quite so tender at least as reasonable and just as what jane felt for bingley      437.88099755132436
 her astonishment at his comingat his coming to netherfield to longbourn and voluntarily seeking her again was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire      622.8286670397963
 the colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a minute with an additional glow and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken      332.887302238342
 let me first see how he behaves said she it will then be early enough for expectation      3864.3231852639483
 jane looked a little paler than usual but more sedate than elizabeth had expected      134.7722248378548
 on the gentlemens appearing her colour increased yet she received them with tolerable ease and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance      883.2146307860264
 elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow and sat down again to her work with an eagerness which it did not often command      691.6018358374163
 she had ventured only one glance at darcy      344.6413693781092
 he looked serious as usual and she thought more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire than as she had seen him at pemberley      397.50337136669185
 but perhaps he could not in her mothers presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt      1212.7341258238514
 it was a painful but not an improbable conjecture      621.7018360250552
 he was received by mrs      814.6955581649441
 bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend      695.4298488911129
 elizabeth particularly who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied      443.29251748003634
 darcy after enquiring of her how mr      97.83758319273011
 gardiner did a question which she could not answer without confusion said scarcely any thing      78.82694308789921
 there he had talked to her friends when he could not to herself      454.898293933996
 but now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice and when occasionally unable to resist the impulse of curiosity she raised her eyes to his face she as often found him looking at jane as at herself and frequently on no object but the ground      793.517019855749
 more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please than when they last met were plainly expressed      453.4098916417989
 she was disappointed and angry with herself for being so      1082.6528877142478
 could i expect it to be otherwise      87.72002128065957
 said she      2056.6665453882724
 yet why did he come      814.6955581649441
 she enquired after his sister but could do no more      474.82279911723055
 it is a long time mr      586.6595363047983
 bingley since you went away said mrs      409.89435694249676
 i began to be afraid you would never come back again      362.5124862393912
 people did say you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas but however i hope it is not true      317.10362777296996
 a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood since you went away      279.2028727458556
 miss lucas is married and settled      2826.0051835090194
 and one of my own daughters      45.567935788034156
 i suppose you have heard of it indeed you must have seen it in the papers      529.3434333867855
 it was in the times and the courier i know though it was not put in as it ought to be      1225.5263513935786
 it was only said lately george wickham esq      827.5845652120538
 to miss lydia bennet without there being a syllable said of her father or the place where she lived or any thing      762.9223262525104
 it was my brother gardiners drawing up too and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it      506.39337127326104
 did you see it      45.693014538637115
 bingley replied that he did and made his congratulations      244.55606762089144
 elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes      457.17126674288704
 how mr      40.11910197869102
 it is a delightful thing to be sure to have a daughter well married continued her mother but at the same time mr      309.20066303383845
 bingley it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me      404.8668849312543
 they are gone down to newcastle a place quite northward it seems and there they are to stay i do not know how long      271.92919192133286
 his regiment is there for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire and of his being gone into the regulars      935.2829329299509
 thank heaven      1454.2828608835578
 elizabeth who knew this to be levelled at mr      1418.141328129121
 it drew from her however the exertion of speaking which nothing else had so effectually done before and she asked bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present      974.5902427641103
 a few weeks he believed      790.2729731686179
 when you have killed all your own birds mr      213.70770124255236
 bingley said her mother i beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on mr      363.37154697656223
 bennets manor      2056.6665453882724
 i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you and will save all the best of the covies for you      533.387468306399
 elizabeths misery increased at such unnecessary such officious attention      1418.141328129121
 were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago every thing she was persuaded would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion      2149.8548246223468
 at that instant she felt that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion      966.0342872480398
 the first wish of my heart said she to herself is never more to be in company with either of them      1022.1741057064672
 let me never see either one or the other again      1918.9377394372916
 yet the misery for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation received soon afterwards material relief from observing how much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her former lover      713.362322104986
 when first he came in he had spoken to her but little but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention      833.4876156576677
 jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever      429.5795035361675
 but her mind was so busily engaged that she did not always know when she was silent      642.209642530623
 when the gentlemen rose to go away mrs      646.3283631123255
 bennet was mindful of her intended civility and they were invited and engaged to dine at longbourn in a few days time      892.1121563276714
 you are quite a visit in my debt mr      104.7566684648142
 bingley she added for when you went to town last winter you promised to take a family dinner with us as soon as you returned      359.0882859424224
 i have not forgot you see and i assure you i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement      254.9030451328626
 they then went away      1729.4435253892393
 bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day but though she always kept a very good table she did not think any thing less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand ayear      466.22105113546155
 chapter xii      620.1082954481221
 as soon as they were gone elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits or in other words to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more      654.3330229651405
 why if he came only to be silent grave and indifferent said she did he come at all      457.93824538905034
 she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure      294.21892384148407
 he could be still amiable still pleasing to my uncle and aunt when he was in town and why not to me      475.60654955915504
 if he fears me why come hither      325.7009922284426
 if he no longer cares for me why silent      204.51026367313972
 teazing teazing man      6063.984910895558
 i will think no more about him      129.8478204801193
 her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister who joined her with a cheerful look which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors than elizabeth      372.46108708322566
 now said she that this first meeting is over i feel perfectly easy      526.7575900460033
 i know my own strength and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming      182.89643405464827
 it will then be publicly seen that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance      809.3648448371129
 yes very indifferent indeed said elizabeth laughingly      1293.9253291434882
 oh jane take care      40.11910197869102
 my dear lizzy you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now      124.87940123670722
 i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever      100.14220439352646
 they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday and mrs      165.30266447272706
 bennet in the meanwhile was giving way to all the happy schemes which the good humour and common politeness of bingley in half an hours visit had revived      1163.4469823197996
 on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn and the two who were most anxiously expected to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen were in very good time      548.990372117953
 when they repaired to the diningroom elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place which in all their former parties had belonged to him by her sister      536.0643382395414
 her prudent mother occupied by the same ideas forbore to invite him to sit by herself      704.8260778148694
 on entering the room he seemed to hesitate but jane happened to look round and happened to smile it was decided      365.1565849984845
 he placed himself by her      935.8394474874626
 he bore it with noble indifference and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards mr      646.6144811253633
 darcy with an expression of halflaughing alarm      97.83758319273011
 his behaviour to her sister was such during dinner time as shewed an admiration of her which though more guarded than formerly persuaded elizabeth that if left wholly to himself janes happiness and his own would be speedily secured      583.9335961215485
 though she dared not depend upon the consequence she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour      301.2992846901565
 it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast for she was in no cheerful humour      239.4680184877613
 darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them      244.88879055850825
 he was on one side of her mother      845.6522872991771
 she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did      360.59712823642815
 her mothers ungraciousness made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeths mind and she would at times have given any thing to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family      1135.1348488675349
 she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance      630.4503326378306
 anxious and uneasy the period which passed in the drawingroom before the gentlemen came was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil      496.3102380995579
 she looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend      353.6472638251771
 the gentlemen came and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes but alas      1738.9896933183763
 the ladies had crowded round the table where miss bennet was making tea and elizabeth pouring out the coffee in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair      433.51752692045335
 and on the gentlemens approaching one of the girls moved closer to her than ever and said in a whisper the men shant come and part us i am determined      700.8923249579573
 we want none of them do we      1072.26800372346
 darcy had walked away to another part of the room      80.82472835959233
 she followed him with her eyes envied every one to whom he spoke had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee and then was enraged against herself for being so silly      738.899487844258
 a man who has once been refused      153.70326304610043
 how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love      180.46093006825262
 is there one among the sex who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman      504.7625807692168
 there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings      1302.7089954291175
 she was a little revived however by his bringing back his coffee cup himself and she seized the opportunity of saying is your sister at pemberley still      593.4700321792157
 yes she will remain there till christmas      1428.6093873842615
 and quite alone      51.75681083503038
 have all her friends left her      169.27659545907346
 annesley is with her      48.563886095782074
 the others have been gone on to scarborough these three weeks      1267.6333043210827
 when the teathings were removed and the card tables placed the ladies all rose and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her mothers rapacity for whist players and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party      898.1071778443389
 she now lost every expectation of pleasure      420.13736348096677
 they were confined for the evening at different tables and she had nothing to hope but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself      613.7056967179002
 well girls said she as soon as they were left to themselves what say you to the day      410.6932534137951
 i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well i assure you      295.6905526752211
 the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw      338.1854251022961
 the venison was roasted to a turnand everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch      797.5566636438082
 darcy acknowledged that the partridges were remarkably well done and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least      304.8891012087282
 and my dear jane i never saw you look in greater beauty      169.27659545907346
 long said so too for i asked her whether you did not      175.73632566154058
 and what do you think she said besides      114.60547728798599
 bennet we shall have her at netherfield at last      2730.5335421894088
 she did indeed      697.5408648064462
 i do think mrs      45.693014538637115
 long is as good a creature as ever livedand her nieces are very pretty behaved girls and not at all handsome i like them prodigiously      202.5458805673724
 bennet in short was in very great spirits she had seen enough of bingleys behaviour to jane to be convinced that she would get him at last and her expectations of advantage to her family when in a happy humour were so far beyond reason that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day to make his proposals      600.0062295683126
 it has been a very agreeable day said miss bennet to elizabeth      1187.6324326164536
 the party seemed so well selected so suitable one with the other      1013.1587835238822
 i hope we may often meet again      409.89435694249676
 elizabeth smiled      2056.6665453882724
 lizzy you must not do so      43.75391731724056
 you must not suspect me      40.119101978691035
 it mortifies me      522.6542288787506
 i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are that he never had any design of engaging my affection      1239.345718506123
 it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man      335.9269693222479
 you are very cruel said her sister you will not let me smile and are provoking me to it every moment      241.96910557520457
 how hard it is in some cases to be believed      88.79645567877174
 and how impossible in others      46.74347398462845
 but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge      312.73942484117237
 chapter xiii      620.1082954481221
 bingley called again and alone      215.01817017506332
 his friend had left him that morning for london but was to return home in ten days time      242.49719253048403
 next time you call said she i hope we shall be more lucky      1306.2011938495266
 he should be particularly happy at any time c      249.29623948049425
 and if she would give him leave would take an early opportunity of waiting on them      281.47324974999435
 can you come tomorrow      190.9288693559034
 yes he had no engagement at all for tomorrow and her invitation was accepted with alacrity      314.638943666064
 he came and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them dressed      281.04526118720787
 in ran mrs      47.71804916323267
 bennet to her daughters room in her dressing gown and with her hair half finished crying out my dear jane make haste and hurry down      666.2050034722758
 he is comemr      553.6385512922801
 bingley is come      631.7212696375212
he is indeed      553.6385512922801
 make haste make haste      347.71207448182764
 never mind miss lizzys hair      935.8394474874626
 we will be down as soon as we can said jane but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us for she went up stairs half an hour ago      685.1028263607709
 hang kitty      40.11910197869102
 what has she to do with it      348.16526261803807
 come be quick be quick      2798.001112032436
 but when her mother was gone jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters      843.4257349775395
 the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening      1243.1118956242224
 after tea mr      417.6886044827121
 bennet retired to the library as was his custom and mary went up stairs to her instrument      1488.5297428320962
 two obstacles of the five being thus removed mrs      2730.5335421894088
 bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time without making any impression on them      497.4499462315466
 elizabeth would not observe her and when at last kitty did she very innocently said what is the matter mamma      409.23849555719227
 what do you keep winking at me for      265.7548253691684
 nothing child nothing      40.11910197869101
 i did not wink at you      47.71804916323267
 she then sat still five minutes longer but unable to waste such a precious occasion she suddenly got up and saying to kitty come here my love i want to speak to you took her out of the room      844.4278579723847
 jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation and her intreaty that she would not give into it      233.32153447017578
 in a few minutes mrs      48.7335340966758
 bennet half opened the door and called out lizzy my dear i want to speak with you      937.8410304759228
 elizabeth was forced to go      215.01817017506332
 we may as well leave them by themselves you know said her mother as soon as she was in the hall      869.2362959916711
 kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in my dressingroom      166.37251194802383
 elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother but remained quietly in the hall till she and kitty were out of sight then returned into the drawingroom      1516.720374006447
 his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party and he bore with the illjudged officiousness of the mother and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter      702.0102042255559
 he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper and before he went away an engagement was formed chiefly through his own and mrs      554.8491355396721
 bennets means for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband      4116.218508212061
 after this day jane said no more of her indifference      778.8843761040267
 not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded unless mr      1527.6030520983645
 seriously however she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentlemans concurrence      693.8718009958246
 bingley was punctual to his appointment and he and mr      418.53834730688436
 there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley that could provoke his ridicule or disgust him into silence and he was more communicative and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him      786.3999584112378
 bingley of course returned with him to dinner and in the evening mrs      345.9822000489869
 bennets invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter      1274.9441817292557
 elizabeth who had a letter to write went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea for as the others were all going to sit down to cards she could not be wanted to counteract her mothers schemes      727.2656985597102
 but on returning to the drawingroom when her letter was finished she saw to her infinite surprise there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her      290.11289431102193
 on opening the door she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth as if engaged in earnest conversation and had this led to no suspicion the faces of both as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other would have told it all      560.8416674493718
 their situation was awkward enough but hers she thought was still worse      591.7959468706296
 not a syllable was uttered by either and elizabeth was on the point of going away again when bingley who as well as the other had sat down suddenly rose and whispering a few words to her sister ran out of the room      647.6897574364082
 jane could have no reserves from elizabeth where confidence would give pleasure and instantly embracing her acknowledged with the liveliest emotion that she was the happiest creature in the world      410.599720310113
 tis too much      501.39750398664387
 i do not deserve it      44.519480662564156
 why is not every body as happy      371.25101893105585
 elizabeths congratulations were given with a sincerity a warmth a delight which words could but poorly express      605.1091532801244
 every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane      2056.6665453882715
 but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister or say half that remained to be said for the present      333.95963675137205
 i must go instantly to my mother she cried      586.5929186828645
 i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude or allow her to hear it from any one but myself      108.49304922798581
 he is gone to my father already      452.5600612142813
 lizzy to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family      140.14669113242152
 she then hastened away to her mother who had purposely broken up the card party and was sitting up stairs with kitty      1065.8608956983228
 elizabeth who was left by herself now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation      1220.6270623136018
 and this said she is the end of all his friends anxious circumspection      314.27687326985125
 of all his sisters falsehood and contrivance      109.50230017631156
 the happiest wisest most reasonable end      493.23587565936685
 in a few minutes she was joined by bingley whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose      1182.895151886316
 where is your sister      1729.4435253892393
 said he hastily as he opened the door      367.8042227944267
 with my mother up stairs      787.0244700034826
 she will be down in a moment i dare say      448.5782936973171
 elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship      473.4765724509884
 they shook hands with great cordiality and then till her sister came down she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness and of janes perfections and in spite of his being a lover elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded because they had for basis the excellent understanding and superexcellent disposition of jane and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself      424.35406825073403
 it was an evening of no common delight to them all the satisfaction of miss bennets mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face as made her look handsomer than ever      381.8534522641824
 kitty simpered and smiled and hoped her turn was coming soon      1484.0546724712444
 bennet joined them at supper his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was      728.1261289540864
 not a word however passed his lips in allusion to it till their visitor took his leave for the night but as soon as he was gone he turned to his daughter and said jane i congratulate you      532.6747811306975
 you will be a very happy woman      118.41906196486444
 jane went to him instantly kissed him and thanked him for his goodness      749.2902918213479
 you are a good girl he replied and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled      65.8896323498867
 you are each of you so complying that nothing will ever be resolved on so easy that every servant will cheat you and so generous that you will always exceed your income      256.175597900575
 i hope not so      45.693014538637115
 imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in me      1212.2697082085213
 exceed their income      5297.3787566140445
 why he has four or five thousand ayear and very likely more      306.1340377639357
 then addressing her daughter oh      814.6955581649441
 my dear dear jane i am so happy      316.0375291753207
 i knew how it would be      162.5378466980104
 i always said it must be so at last      268.33348328130614
 i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing      841.2609480738329
 i remember as soon as ever i saw him when he first came into hertfordshire last year i thought how likely it was that you should come together      1025.187706123502
 he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen      985.8271866093645
 wickham lydia were all forgotten      559.6489556452747
 jane was beyond competition her favourite child      384.4056154820648
 at that moment she cared for no other      717.441829066389
 her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense      694.8270833411717
 mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter      645.1480896658068
 elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister for while he was present jane had no attention to bestow on any one else but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur      589.1434791154581
 in the absence of jane he always attached himself to elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her and when bingley was gone jane constantly sought the same means of relief      626.1162317755
 he has made me so happy said she one evening by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring      791.2625340338496
 i had not believed it possible      49.69641882427861
 i suspected as much replied elizabeth      677.7409514593107
 but how did he account for it      344.6535336432692
 it must have been his sisters doing      1143.3667619685148
 they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me which i cannot wonder at since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects      470.27090308921044
 but when they see as i trust they will that their brother is happy with me they will learn to be contented and we shall be on good terms again though we can never be what we once were to each other      933.923229722368
 that is the most unforgiving speech said elizabeth that i ever heard you utter      1163.4469823197996
 good girl      40.11910197869102
 it would vex me indeed to see you again the dupe of miss bingleys pretended regard      679.8084172976244
 would you believe it lizzy that when he went to town last november he really loved me and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again      266.97081199802204
 he made a little mistake to be sure but it is to the credit of his modesty      671.7340241644739
 elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend for though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him      776.5042316136454
 i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed      781.1661467142784
 cried jane      620.1082954481221
 lizzy why am i thus singled from my family and blessed above them all      128.8881299894512
 if i could but see you as happy      198.24891313985407
 if there were but such another man for you      1089.391740455925
 till i have your disposition your goodness i never can have your happiness      146.75282584176244
 no no let me shift for myself and perhaps if i have very good luck i may meet with another mr      685.3681723922083
 collins in time      248.94042605864988
 the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a secret      688.0660068171243
 bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs      1885.9715376448294
 the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world though only a few weeks before when lydia had first run away they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune      1538.7299057076284
 chapter xiv      620.1082954481221
 one morning about a week after bingleys engagement with jane had been formed as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the diningroom their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the sound of a carriage and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn      617.2736828120143
 it was too early in the morning for visitors and besides the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours      319.6470636808505
 the horses were post and neither the carriage nor the livery of the servant who preceded it were familiar to them      2480.7530567160816
 as it was certain however that somebody was coming bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion and walk away with him into the shrubbery      816.659009294552
 it was lady catherine de bourgh      516.7497138521829
 they were of course all intending to be surprised but their astonishment was beyond their expectation and on the part of mrs      828.7528807302343
 bennet and kitty though she was perfectly unknown to them even inferior to what elizabeth felt      731.3626852462
 she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious made no other reply to elizabeths salutation than a slight inclination of the head and sat down without saying a word      607.8557648077089
 elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyships entrance though no request of introduction had been made      665.5743387824828
 bennet all amazement though flattered by having a guest of such high importance received her with the utmost politeness      1201.564181224546
 after sitting for a moment in silence she said very stiffly to elizabeth i hope you are well miss bennet      561.3470216976789
 that lady i suppose is your mother      348.16526261803807
 elizabeth replied very concisely that she was      457.17126674288704
 and that i suppose is one of your sisters      234.48582746820404
 yes madam said mrs      2056.6665453882724
 bennet delighted to speak to a lady catherine      1885.9715376448294
 my youngest of all is lately married and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds walking with a young man who i believe will soon become a part of the family      400.2192683499556
 you have a very small park here returned lady catherine after a short silence      137.80852986475443
 this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening in summer the windows are full west      1426.185425388802
 bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner and then added may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr      1128.4607681186562
 collins well      620.1082954481221
 i saw them the night before last      457.171266742887
 elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling      2025.2120216825624
 but no letter appeared and she was completely puzzled      213.70770124255236
 bennet with great civility begged her ladyship to take some refreshment but lady catherine very resolutely and not very politely declined eating any thing and then rising up said to elizabeth miss bennet there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn      563.5940147812496
 i should be glad to take a turn in it if you will favour me with your company      166.3427775769464
 go my dear cried her mother and shew her ladyship about the different walks      192.95070440363713
 i think she will be pleased with the hermitage      100.019063555426
 elizabeth obeyed and running into her own room for her parasol attended her noble guest down stairs      1063.0137982589442
 as they passed through the hall lady catherine opened the doors into the diningparlour and drawingroom and pronouncing them after a short survey to be decent looking rooms walked on      591.4198372578848
 her carriage remained at the door and elizabeth saw that her waitingwoman was in it      189.3053612912492
 they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable      579.7218064440373
 how could i ever think her like her nephew      163.72306807567136
 said she as she looked in her face      401.09334906425755
 as soon as they entered the copse lady catherine began in the following manner you can be at no loss miss bennet to understand the reason of my journey hither      909.0997096523815
 your own heart your own conscience must tell you why i come      140.67046738788886
 elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment      215.01817017506332
 i have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here      487.5677401802983
 miss bennet replied her ladyship in an angry tone you ought to know that i am not to be trifled with      1851.8349361377916
 but however insincere you may choose to be you shall not find me so      622.1857852170444
 a report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago      487.0203028465471
 though i know it must be a scandalous falsehood though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible i instantly resolved on setting off for this place that i might make my sentiments known to you      427.65959022103135
 if you believed it impossible to be true said elizabeth colouring with astonishment and disdain i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far      676.9793821300676
 what could your ladyship propose by it      761.2599170904274
 at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted      534.0902241587986
 your coming to longbourn to see me and my family said elizabeth coolly will be rather a confirmation of it if indeed such a report is in existence      145.67166372834245
 do you then pretend to be ignorant of it      89.09673705835279
 do you not know that such a report is spread abroad      77.06547735278049
 i never heard that it was      162.5378466980104
 and can you likewise declare that there is no foundation for it      71.91929341677493
 i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship      165.30266447272706
 you may ask questions which i shall not choose to answer      192.94673551776444
 miss bennet i insist on being satisfied      4739.323204102207
 has he has my nephew made you an offer of marriage      420.41560823563583
 your ladyship has declared it to be impossible      42.452164578489544
 it ought to be so it must be so while he retains the use of his reason      589.4522786210308
 but your arts and allurements may in a moment of infatuation have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family      206.56509892046643
 you may have drawn him in      149.03516866374105
 miss bennet do you know who i am      6984.315616499562
 i have not been accustomed to such language as this      100.25316076713236
 i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns      690.9914078401654
 but you are not entitled to know mine nor will such behaviour as this ever induce me to be explicit      398.72802163073663
 let me be rightly understood      814.6955581649441
 this match to which you have the presumption to aspire can never take place      980.3054242661333
 darcy is engaged to my daughter      113.50930596523533
 now what have you to say      439.4232093657577
 only this that if he is so you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me      359.5496081162602
 lady catherine hesitated for a moment and then replied the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind      337.361443891427
 from their infancy they have been intended for each other      773.376729806983
 it was the favourite wish of his mother as well as of hers      1331.9000262843508
 while in their cradles we planned the union and now at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth of no importance in the world and wholly unallied to the family      353.3852910614362
 do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends      87.98209908096486
 to his tacit engagement with miss de bourgh      306.5539012303626
 are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy      95.16968476378769
 have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin      166.027366438384
 yes and i had heard it before      468.5956940255123
 if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew i shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh      612.761761855283
 you both did as much as you could in planning the marriage      145.38771950669346
 if mr      48.8989988170858
 darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin why is not he to make another choice      467.3878028359727
 and if i am that choice why may not i accept him      161.44148879839534
 because honour decorum prudence nay interest forbid it      4892.747817760432
 yes miss bennet interest for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all      3535.5921393859467
 you will be censured slighted and despised by every one connected with him      243.62595290484504
 these are heavy misfortunes replied elizabeth      7640.142235482199
 darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation that she could upon the whole have no cause to repine      659.5457561637751
 obstinate headstrong girl      553.6385512922801
 i am ashamed of you      250.52146603727175
 is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring      402.1911977258977
 is nothing due to me on that score      306.5539012303626
 let us sit down      1729.4435253892393
 you are to understand miss bennet that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose nor will i be dissuaded from it      278.8970395410096
 i have not been used to submit to any persons whims      177.1935613779865
 i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment      100.25316076713236
 that will make your ladyships situation at present more pitiable but it will have no effect on me      356.8640653890074
 i will not be interrupted      202.60430451798896
 hear me in silence      321.6287148705544
 my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other      195.1453320693975
 they are descended on the maternal side from the same noble line and on the fathers from respectable honourable and ancient though untitled families      697.5951834070341
 their fortune on both sides is splendid      371.25101893105585
 they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses and what is to divide them      671.0475649039689
 the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family connections or fortune      1952.7484148950641
 is this to be endured      1038.4850141414397
 but it must not shall not be      1035.5743332476811
 if you were sensible of your own good you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up      878.6490120768473
 in marrying your nephew i should not consider myself as quitting that sphere      84.46844933505649
 he is a gentleman i am a gentlemans daughter so far we are equal      417.0930697981887
 true      40.11910197869102
 you are a gentlemans daughter      40.119101978691035
 but who was your mother      814.6955581649441
 do not imagine me ignorant of their condition      98.44091095009432
 whatever my connections may be said elizabeth if your nephew does not object to them they can be nothing to you      892.7057134887979
 tell me once for all are you engaged to him      873.1690792873802
 though elizabeth would not for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherine have answered this question she could not but say after a moments deliberation i am not      272.3806393848298
 lady catherine seemed pleased      48.56388609578208
 and will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement      81.23086834654195
 i will make no promise of the kind      112.1177133433459
 miss bennet i am shocked and astonished      4739.323204102207
 i expected to find a more reasonable young woman      5082.067017290794
 but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede      221.9132379499782
 i shall not go away till you have given me the assurance i require      135.43005823001494
 and i certainly never shall give it      48.199563998586285
 i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable      340.37417883099084
 your ladyship wants mr      40.11910197869102
 supposing him to be attached to me would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin      945.2471535509926
 allow me to say lady catherine that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was illjudged      324.9851603523193
 you have widely mistaken my character if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these      221.7359251762278
 how far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs i cannot tell but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine      412.4596256784908
 i must beg therefore to be importuned no farther on the subject      1114.3663075586053
 not so hasty if you please      493.23587565936685
 to all the objections i have already urged i have still another to add      363.98729885561863
 i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sisters infamous elopement      282.1716623886649
 i know it all that the young mans marrying her was a patchedup business at the expence of your father and uncles      230.58757847169434
 and is such a girl to be my nephews sister      253.0851184258554
 is her husband is the son of his late fathers steward to be his brother      391.3615799272417
 heaven and earth      553.6385512922801
of what are you thinking      590.4747726465007
 are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted      558.0211346538733
 you can now have nothing farther to say she resentfully answered      70.74931785885057
 you have insulted me in every possible method      44.13999885317416
 i must beg to return to the house      820.2760236494913
 and she rose as she spoke      169.27659545907346
 lady catherine rose also and they turned back      92.6104592782635
 you have no regard then for the honour and credit of my nephew      77.96975103921504
 unfeeling selfish girl      40.11910197869101
 do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody      143.10925744457347
 lady catherine i have nothing farther to say      92.6104592782635
 you know my sentiments      40.11910197869102
 you are then resolved to have him      44.74640931628707
 i have said no such thing      49.69641882427861
 it is well      522.6542288787506
 you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends and make him the contempt of the world      550.9608867838855
 no principle of either would be violated by my marriage with mr      256.53141591449065
 and with regard to the resentment of his family or the indignation of the world if the former were excited by his marrying me it would not give me one moments concernand the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn      701.0747724746956
 and this is your real opinion      150.80830190564933
 this is your final resolve      904.0537140354138
 very well      40.11910197869102
 i shall now know how to act      163.89484864115948
 do not imagine miss bennet that your ambition will ever be gratified      156.56326726255972
 i came to try you      145.70499561848857
 i hoped to find you reasonable but depend upon it i will carry my point      301.104484439974
 i send no compliments to your mother      452.5600612142813
 you deserve no such attention      40.119101978691035
 i am most seriously displeased      250.52146603727175
 she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs      392.20285255752265
 her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressingroom to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself      759.8745015040204
 she did not choose it said her daughter she would go      187.50488226368932
 she is a very finelooking woman      663.8157882572414
 and her calling here was prodigiously civil      137.80852986475443
 for she only came i suppose to tell us the collinses were well      230.08311443710537
 she is on her road somewhere i dare say and so passing through meryton thought she might as well call on you      279.86258795635297
 i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you lizzy      1710.0312306109238
 elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible      1215.0596372257555
 chapter xv      620.1082954481221
 the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into could not be easily overcome nor could she for many hours learn to think of it less than incessantly      1492.1004395965006
 lady catherine it appeared had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr      619.8631545879006
 it was a rational scheme to be sure      827.5845652120538
 but from what the report of their engagement could originate elizabeth was at a loss to imagine till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley and her being the sister of jane was enough at a time when the expectation of one wedding made every body eager for another to supply the idea      579.9368292644025
 she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together      520.6457318517815
 and her neighbours at lucas lodge therefore for through their communication with the collinses the report she concluded had reached lady catherine had only set that down as almost certain and immediate which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time      399.85604109781576
 in revolving lady catherines expressions however she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference      145.82817155274756
 from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared not pronounce      435.15179835414534
 she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt or his dependence on her judgment but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do and it was certain that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own his aunt would address him on his weakest side      632.2447054168276
 with his notions of dignity he would probably feel that the arguments which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous contained much good sense and solid reasoning      304.49857580606545
 if he had been wavering before as to what he should do which had often seemed likely the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him      642.1343116784768
 lady catherine might see him in her way through town and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way      417.9847150225581
 if therefore an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days she added i shall know how to understand it      1023.1539159565399
 i shall then give over every expectation every wish of his constancy      319.7013638092552
 if he is satisfied with only regretting me when he might have obtained my affections and hand i shall soon cease to regret him at all      833.7746573247867
 the surprise of the rest of the family on hearing who their visitor had been was very great but they obligingly satisfied it with the same kind of supposition which had appeased mrs      1297.4503390437567
 the next morning as she was going down stairs she was met by her father who came out of his library with a letter in his hand      739.5937502021029
 lizzy said he i was going to look for you come into my room      147.69291666732659
 she followed him thither and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held      452.71185951396296
 she followed her father to the fire place and they both sat down      732.5289673974371
 he then said i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly      366.3537919341016
 as it principally concerns yourself you ought to know its contents      404.7942001568998
 i did not know before that i had two daughters on the brink of matrimony      112.02024274346924
 let me congratulate you on a very important conquest      2259.3577062289846
 the colour now rushed into elizabeths cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew instead of the aunt and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself when her father continued you look conscious      546.6456570166818
 young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these but i think i may defy even your sagacity to discover the name of your admirer      275.0919425952756
 this letter is from mr      904.0537140354138
 and what can he have to say      124.8164466359274
 i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says on that point      373.68831868664216
 what relates to yourself is as follows      348.16526261803807
 having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs      102.76480283139172
 collins and myself on this happy event let me now add a short hint on the subject of another of which we have been advertised by the same authority      342.3522622905233
 your daughter elizabeth it is presumed will not long bear the name of bennet after her elder sister has resigned it and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land      516.8441753624023
 can you possibly guess lizzy who is meant by this      164.55909805999227
 this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way with every thing the heart of mortal can most desiresplendid property noble kindred and extensive patronage      391.02075988872235
 yet in spite of all these temptations let me warn my cousin elizabeth and yourself of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentlemans proposals which of course you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of      1519.5148007458595
 have you any idea lizzy who this gentleman is      104.75666846481418
 but now it comes out      814.6955581649441
 my motive for cautioning you is as follows      740.5751839787724
 we have reason to imagine that his aunt lady catherine de bourgh does not look on the match with a friendly eye      533.4552215556357
 darcy you see is the man      113.50930596523533
 now lizzy i think i have surprised you      105.05698375244035
 could he or the lucases have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related      422.7275356088621
 darcy who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish and who probably never looked at you in his life      216.0745484414179
 it is admirable      522.6542288787506
 elizabeth tried to join in her fathers pleasantry but could only force one most reluctant smile      788.9905928883518
 are you not diverted      347.71207448182764
 pray read on      553.6385512922801
 after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night she immediately with her usual condescension expressed what she felt on the occasion when it became apparent that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match      362.1183108920255
 i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned      646.1485140439447
 i must not however neglect the duties of my station or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married      774.9591727003454
 it was an encouragement of vice and had i been the rector of longbourn i should very strenuously have opposed it      546.3488852794525
 that is his notion of christian forgiveness      368.4191768864797
 the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlottes situation and his expectation of a young olivebranch      1043.0377077240678
 but lizzy you look as if you did not enjoy it      165.30266447272706
 you are not going to be missish i hope and pretend to be affronted at an idle report      99.4436336618511
 for what do we live but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our turn      280.7332433613256
 but it is so strange      814.6955581649441
 yesthat is what makes it amusing      2056.6665453882715
 had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing but his perfect indifference and your pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd      244.6374438352737
 much as i abominate writing i would not give up mr      330.66150190515646
 nay when i read a letter of his i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my soninlaw      341.64478185286055
 to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh and as it had been asked without the least suspicion she was not distressed by his repeating it      403.3679475987286
 elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not      440.30190069148443
 it was necessary to laugh when she would rather have cried      1220.1155810554142
 her father had most cruelly mortified her by what he said of mr      401.92718798876575
 darcys indifference and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration or fear that perhaps instead of his seeing too little she might have fancied too much      532.4797065377251
 chapter xvi      620.1082954481221
 instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend as elizabeth half expected mr      1060.5468042430941
 bingley to do he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherines visit      352.8983564746096
 the gentlemen arrived early and before mrs      1061.4526955302235
 bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt of which her daughter sat in momentary dread bingley who wanted to be alone with jane proposed their all walking out      808.0486158817271
 it was agreed to      275.1051068147718
 bennet was not in the habit of walking mary could never spare time but the remaining five set off together      899.3712812141108
 bingley and jane however soon allowed the others to outstrip them      188.71842365175766
 they lagged behind while elizabeth kitty and darcy were to entertain each other      248.23682240534086
 very little was said by either kitty was too much afraid of him to talk elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution and perhaps he might be doing the same      761.8471956690803
 they walked towards the lucases because kitty wished to call upon maria and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern when kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone      1123.0351027916895
 darcy i am a very selfish creature and for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings care not how much i may be wounding yours      317.2296790957651
 ever since i have known it i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it      427.9692502083814
 were it known to the rest of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to express      625.013218142369
 i am sorry exceedingly sorry replied darcy in a tone of surprise and emotion that you have ever been informed of what may in a mistaken light have given you uneasiness      303.0799635333693
 i did not think mrs      48.186967378956886
 gardiner was so little to be trusted      48.199563998586285
 you must not blame my aunt      149.03516866374105
 lydias thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter and of course i could not rest till i knew the particulars      900.5533620202435
 let me thank you again and again in the name of all my family for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble and bear so many mortifications for the sake of discovering them      132.22940907156
 if you will thank me he replied let it be for yourself alone      122.26234172998302
 that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on i shall not attempt to deny      344.47459083263277
 but your family owe me nothing      493.23587565936685
 much as i respect them i believe i thought only of you      277.36240737411515
 elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word      1418.141328129121
 after a short pause her companion added you are too generous to trifle with me      525.782562611807
 if your feelings are still what they were last april tell me so at once      283.26172118436324
 my affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever      604.8576188937643
 elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation now forced herself to speak and immediately though not very fluently gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change since the period to which he alluded as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances      653.3442299443469
 the happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never felt before and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do      841.3325855564239
 had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt delight diffused over his face became him but though she could not look she could listen and he told her of feelings which in proving of what importance she was to him made his affection every moment more valuable      730.7029342038759
 they walked on without knowing in what direction      683.9145616261229
 there was too much to be thought and felt and said for attention to any other objects      989.777244598376
 she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt who did call on him in her return through london and there relate her journey to longbourn its motive and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which in her ladyships apprehension peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which she had refused to give      719.3727947748114
 but unluckily for her ladyship its effect had been exactly contrariwise      259.3808303129927
 it taught me to hope said he as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before      591.9179748328114
 i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that had you been absolutely irrevocably decided against me you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly      263.18517573417313
 elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied yes you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that      389.0539641167924
 after abusing you so abominably to your face i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations      435.2862255305359
 what did you say of me that i did not deserve      166.37251194802383
 for though your accusations were illfounded formed on mistaken premises my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof      180.09274557611565
 it was unpardonable      522.6542288787506
 i cannot think of it without abhorrence      105.387871890059
 we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening said elizabeth      268.0485049180707
 the conduct of neither if strictly examined will be irreproachable but since then we have both i hope improved in civility      551.2624860038632
 i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself      93.40297427451034
 the recollection of what i then said of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of it is now and has been many months inexpressibly painful to me      550.1041437623122
 your reproof so well applied i shall never forget had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner      242.4156754604881
 those were your words      241.5461082312236
 you know not you can scarcely conceive how they have tortured methough it was some time i confess before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice      182.38528398073416
 i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression      643.3548023791063
 i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way      192.4546899973741
 i can easily believe it      145.70499561848857
 you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling i am sure you did      196.39199472039385
 the turn of your countenance i shall never forget as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me      329.20942732074315
 these recollections will not do at all      3609.2988077398218
 i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it      303.1927770483532
 darcy mentioned his letter      48.56388609578208
 did it said he did it soon make you think better of me      161.11160094575897
 she explained what its effect on her had been and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed      1119.6029649666093
 i knew said he that what i wrote must give you pain but it was necessary      321.54917859671986
 i hope you have destroyed the letter      409.89435694249676
 there was one part especially the opening of it which i should dread your having the power of reading again      942.5040812538138
 i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me      972.5217553939831
 the letter shall certainly be burnt if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard but though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable they are not i hope quite so easily changed as that implies      604.0921796340891
 when i wrote that letter replied darcy i believed myself perfectly calm and cool but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit      1210.2087107595335
 the letter perhaps began in bitterness but it did not end so      1729.4435253892386
 but think no more of the letter      961.3828248384349
 the feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten      1000.791508603568
 you must learn some of my philosophy      123.55749986770849
 think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure      80.79878331101224
 i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind      142.48720736858596
 your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy but what is much better of ignorance      1044.1293595095408
 painful recollections will intrude which cannot which ought not to be repelled      441.2482996802594
 as a child i was taught what was right but i was not taught to correct my temper      252.670962266452
 i was given good principles but left to follow them in pride and conceit      246.67008240883538
 unfortunately an only son for many years an only child i was spoilt by my parents who though good themselves my father particularly all that was benevolent and amiable allowed encouraged almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing to care for none beyond my own family circle to think meanly of all the rest of the world to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own      246.62975016701827
 such i was from eight to eight and twenty and such i might still have been but for you dearest loveliest elizabeth      635.8767258207769
 what do i not owe you      499.1041075342648
 you taught me a lesson hard indeed at first but most advantageous      141.50480058341037
 by you i was properly humbled      149.03516866374105
 i came to you without a doubt of my reception      781.1661467142784
 you shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased      646.0673609495939
 had you then persuaded yourself that i should      44.13999885317416
 indeed i had      47.71804916323267
 what will you think of my vanity      971.1785054053564
 i believed you to be wishing expecting my addresses      621.5088372110616
 my manners must have been in fault but not intentionally i assure you      927.4162895114571
 i never meant to deceive you but my spirits might often lead me wrong      696.6101301324896
 i was angry perhaps at first but my anger soon began to take a proper direction      326.48505775503213
 i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at pemberley      506.5762522010058
 you blamed me for coming      40.119101978691035
 no indeed i felt nothing but surprise      43.21515967279812
 your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you      271.04154100064045
 my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness and i confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due      1089.880610049953
 my object then replied darcy was to shew you by every civility in my power that i was not so mean as to resent the past and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness to lessen your ill opinion by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to      655.784072515535
 how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you      294.41375727507983
 he then told her of georgianas delight in her acquaintance and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend      251.86424152027539
 she expressed her gratitude again but it was too painful a subject to each to be dwelt on farther      2664.2405360243165
 after walking several miles in a leisurely manner and too busy to know any thing about it they found at last on examining their watches that it was time to be at home      473.2434581864674
 what could become of mr      826.340678089009
 was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs      462.91962731452884
 darcy was delighted with their engagement his friend had given him the earliest information of it      281.04526118720787
 i must ask whether you were surprised      1262.3792521726189
 said elizabeth      2056.6665453882724
 not at all      40.11910197869101
 when i went away i felt that it would soon happen      649.6262362279273
 i guessed as much      45.693014538637115
 and though he exclaimed at the term she found that it had been pretty much the case      240.83292293523698
 on the evening before my going to london said he i made a confession to him which i believe i ought to have made long ago      571.871204978285
 i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent      135.49244835870587
 his surprise was great      327.15695039771015
 i told him moreover that i believed myself mistaken in supposing as i had done that your sister was indifferent to him and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated i felt no doubt of their happiness together      623.3434694245218
 elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend      721.5052076975221
 from the former      323.76978890742015
 i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here and i was convinced of her affection      242.9015538436536
 and your assurance of it i suppose carried immediate conviction to him      87.8270176670943
 it did      48.8989988170858
 bingley is most unaffectedly modest      215.01817017506332
 his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case but his reliance on mine made every thing easy      496.82875063284166
 i was obliged to confess one thing which for a time and not unjustly offended him      503.6856927328674
 he was angry      553.6385512922801
 he has heartily forgiven me now      160.70162859206835
 elizabeth longed to observe that mr      175.26129507828713
 bingley had been a most delightful friend so easily guided that his worth was invaluable but she checked herself      349.09936421237205
 she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at and it was rather too early to begin      3059.7510865395484
 in the hall they parted      187.18418916480326
 was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room and from all the others when they sat down to table      452.39219181051146
 she had only to say in reply that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own knowledge      232.7651813173224
 the evening passed quietly unmarked by any thing extraordinary      1229.5237429804772
 the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed the unacknowledged were silent      337.42824635452405
 darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth and elizabeth agitated and confused rather knew that she was happy than felt herself to be so for besides the immediate embarrassment there were other evils before her      330.9912520347436
 she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known she was aware that no one liked him but jane and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away      828.7248848277044
 at night she opened her heart to jane      115.5862148862075
 though suspicion was very far from miss bennets general habits she was absolutely incredulous here      525.284930123522
 you are joking lizzy      40.11910197869102
 this cannot be      439.4232093657577
engaged to mr      553.6385512922801
 i know it to be impossible      43.75391731724056
 this is a wretched beginning indeed      603.7985448863138
 my sole dependence was on you and i am sure nobody else will believe me if you do not      1528.2953273354533
 i speak nothing but the truth      2517.6843954461397
 he still loves me and we are engaged      820.2760236494913
 jane looked at her doubtingly      225.75951233528167
 oh lizzy      40.11910197869102
 you know nothing of the matter      40.11910197869101
 that is all to be forgot      499.1041075342648
 perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now      543.0423359957002
 but in such cases as these a good memory is unpardonable      592.5489330766649
 this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself      772.5760326413994
 miss bennet still looked all amazement      2826.0051835090194
 yet now i must believe you cried jane      646.3283631123255
 forgive the questionare you quite certain that you can be happy with him      394.4616001095778
 there can be no doubt of that      1061.4526955302235
 it is settled between us already that we are to be the happiest couple in the world      2646.19005864115
 but are you pleased jane      814.6955581649441
 shall you like to have such a brother      128.7995177991197
 very very much      553.6385512922801
 nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight      94.40006465262863
 but we considered it we talked of it as impossible      1408.7003290791345
 and do you really love him quite well enough      43.67403369673303
 oh lizzy      40.11910197869102
 do any thing rather than marry without affection      44.13999885317416
 are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do      85.17239382046925
 you will only think i feel more than i ought to do when i tell you all      96.28055070875432
 why i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley      680.3190476292395
 i am afraid you will be angry      158.34946572967354
 my dearest sister now be be serious      405.92201397339835
 i want to talk very seriously      164.47162690326306
 let me know every thing that i am to know without delay      950.656096582618
 will you tell me how long you have loved him      86.65830354848481
 it has been coming on so gradually that i hardly know when it began      1082.3449391297954
 but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley      805.1730649909472
 another intreaty that she would be serious however produced the desired effect and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment      428.3274722869043
 when convinced on that article miss bennet had nothing farther to wish      231.85787756641133
 now i am quite happy said she for you will be as happy as myself      336.7982439955993
 were it for nothing but his love of you i must always have esteemed him but now as bingleys friend and your husband there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me      381.8955886759164
 but lizzy you have been very sly very reserved with me      165.30266447272706
 how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton      401.2909342188302
 i owe all that i know of it to another not to you      244.95947177330547
 she had been unwilling to mention bingley and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend      380.3282766466772
 all was acknowledged and half the night spent in conversation      236.202759501154
 good gracious      40.11910197869102
 bennet as she stood at a window the next morning if that disagreeable mr      2282.2831302126833
 darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley      185.79085828812782
 what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here      568.4123244915519
 i had no notion but he would go a shooting or something or other and not disturb us with his company      126.04487646766036
 what shall we do with him      499.1041075342648
 lizzy you must walk out with him again that he may not be in bingleys way      181.40765541583164
 elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet      185.8519227907596
 bennet have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again today      471.9655624417354
 i advise mr      47.71804916323267
 darcy and lizzy and kitty said mrs      97.83758319273011
 it is a nice long walk and mr      346.1822427794401
 darcy has never seen the view      113.50930596523533
 it may do very well for the others replied mr      205.56899392350272
 bingley but i am sure it will be too much for kitty      545.7243846566255
 kitty owned that she had rather stay at home      465.5791080971378
 darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount and elizabeth silently consented      1119.525363326628
 as she went up stairs to get ready mrs      1561.3654889374807
 bennet followed her saying i am quite sorry lizzy that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself      877.3060490069581
 but i hope you will not mind it it is all for janes sake you know and there is no occasion for talking to him except just now and then      247.6054678880728
 so do not put yourself to inconvenience      136.4185399396904
 during their walk it was resolved that mr      42.81544943112701
 bennets consent should be asked in the course of the evening      2365.534780226383
 elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mothers      1418.141328129121
 she could not determine how her mother would take it sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man      594.3229024004736
 darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy than the first vehemence of her disapprobation      165.57655694112358
 in the evening soon after mr      144.80475927254847
 bennet withdrew to the library she saw mr      1885.9715376448294
 darcy rise also and follow him and her agitation on seeing it was extreme      222.2257927653628
 she did not fear her fathers opposition but he was going to be made unhappy and that it should be through her means that she his favourite child should be distressing him by her choice should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her was a wretched reflection and she sat in misery till mr      533.3731380639636
 darcy appeared again when looking at him she was a little relieved by his smile      549.7559360450498
 in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty and while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper go to your father he wants you in the library      882.3342655849116
 she was gone directly      2445.8024889638004
 lizzy said he what are you doing      43.215159672798116
 are you out of your senses to be accepting this man      87.98209908096486
 have not you always hated him      169.27659545907346
 how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable her expressions more moderate      369.4150163979521
 it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give but they were now necessary and she assured him with some confusion of her attachment to mr      531.4047657246028
 or in other words you are determined to have him      86.65830354848481
 he is rich to be sure and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane      513.4305031246512
 but will they make you happy      1632.3773188485725
 have you any other objection said elizabeth than your belief of my indifference      82.68999907280431
 none at all      40.11910197869101
 we all know him to be a proud unpleasant sort of man but this would be nothing if you really liked him      473.9371896295939
 indeed he has no improper pride      603.7985448863138
 he is perfectly amiable      287.24835050978845
 you do not know what he really is then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms      163.36976988290687
 lizzy said her father i have given him my consent      111.78687773292665
 but let me advise you to think better of it      1790.4322196000549
 i know your disposition lizzy      44.519480662564156
 i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable unless you truly esteemed your husband unless you looked up to him as a superior      233.66610363985242
 your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage      122.04203164560963
 you could scarcely escape discredit and misery      87.72002128065957
 my child let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life      479.95722303721135
 you know not what you are about      40.11910197869101
 elizabeth still more affected was earnest and solemn in her reply and at length by repeated assurances that mr      773.7917840236202
 darcy was really the object of her choice by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day but had stood the test of many months suspense and enumerating with energy all his good qualities she did conquer her fathers incredulity and reconcile him to the match      474.1706711221099
 well my dear said he when she ceased speaking i have no more to say      556.2639535303587
 if this be the case he deserves you      656.4615915845678
 to complete the favourable impression she then told him what mr      2085.434775636514
 he heard her with astonishment      193.76542062357612
 this is an evening of wonders indeed      433.7392549148117
 and so darcy did every thing made up the match gave the money paid the fellows debts and got him his commission      170.56463004644345
 so much the better      341.5977821990359
 it will save me a world of trouble and economy      411.36913037216084
 he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading mr      653.6246819886263
 collinss letter and after laughing at her some time allowed her at last to gosaying as she quitted the room if any young men come for mary or kitty send them in for i am quite at leisure      378.8139479467773
 elizabeths mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight and after half an hours quiet reflection in her own room she was able to join the others with tolerable composure      708.4937852425755
 every thing was too recent for gaiety but the evening passed tranquilly away there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time      450.95715656349864
 when her mother went up to her dressingroom at night she followed her and made the important communication      763.8953111958356
 its effect was most extraordinary for on first hearing it mrs      7273.9872108292675
 bennet sat quite still and unable to utter a syllable      2151.8044062433787
 nor was it under many many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them      481.58264495416597
 she began at length to recover to fidget about in her chair get up sit down again wonder and bless herself      576.0978047894597
 good gracious      40.11910197869102
 only think      40.11910197869102
 dear me      40.11910197869102
 and is it really true      46.74347398462845
 my sweetest lizzy      553.6385512922801
 how rich and how great you will be      208.30707095430347
 what pinmoney what jewels what carriages you will have      547.4108018022345
 i am so pleasedso happy      250.52146603727175
so handsome      2908.5657217671155
 so tall      2056.6665453882724
 pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before      225.75951233528167
 i hope he will overlook it      162.5378466980104
 dear dear lizzy      553.6385512922801
 a house in town      48.563886095782074
 every thing that is charming      935.8394474874626
 three daughters married      439.4232093657577
 oh lord      40.11910197869102
 what will become of me      826.340678089009
 i shall go distracted      327.15695039771015
 this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted and elizabeth rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself soon went away      551.5548019524801
 my dearest child she cried i can think of nothing else      1541.325808373988
 ten thousand a year and very likely more      646.3283631123255
 tis as good as a lord      651.0638420095175
 you must and shall be married by a special licence      425.8325071886167
 but my dearest love tell me what dish mr      512.5999343888922
 darcy is particularly fond of that i may have it tomorrow      330.66150190515646
 this was a sad omen of what her mothers behaviour to the gentleman himself might be and elizabeth found that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection and secure of her relations consent there was still something to be wished for      929.3207843796164
 elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him and mr      422.7103809747278
 bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem      829.071004611014
 i admire all my three sonsinlaw highly said he      282.07268750842894
 wickham perhaps is my favourite but i think i shall like your husband quite as well as janes      859.6616865652261
 elizabeths spirits soon rising to playfulness again she wanted mr      992.8478108983953
 how could you begin      241.5461082312236
 said she      2056.6665453882724
 i can comprehend your going on charmingly when you had once made a beginning but what could set you off in the first place      248.152292931695
 it is too long ago      202.60430451798896
 i was in the middle before i knew that i had begun      315.13128851206596
 my beauty you had early withstood and as for my mannersmy behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not      283.6139869826718
 now be sincere did you admire me for my impertinence      973.6236180442825
 for the liveliness of your mind i did      576.3824033891512
 it was very little less      787.0244700034826
 the fact is that you were sick of civility of deference of officious attention      1533.5358432151127
 you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking and thinking for your approbation alone      882.593564524555
 i roused and interested you because i was so unlike them      195.3737146449685
 had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself your feelings were always noble and just and in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you      205.4854833092551
 therei have saved you the trouble of accounting for it and really all things considered i begin to think it perfectly reasonable      377.0655529093169
 to be sure you knew no actual good of mebut nobody thinks of that when they fall in love      482.2063178304816
 was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane while she was ill at netherfield      471.9655624417354
 dearest jane      40.11910197869102
 who could have done less for her      244.68782014861273
 but make a virtue of it by all means      1338.4711704261013
 my good qualities are under your protection and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible and in return it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last      234.89236056532326
 what made you so shy of me when you first called and afterwards dined here      330.6438800244852
 why especially when you called did you look as if you did not care about me      716.950017780351
 because you were grave and silent and gave me no encouragement      1320.0450453555013
 but i was embarrassed      1729.4435253892393
 and so was i      48.563886095782074
 you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner      146.90473689264306
 a man who had felt less might      153.70326304610043
 how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it      141.84033046382146
 but i wonder how long you would have gone on if you had been left to yourself      370.9319288571703
 my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect      394.93850696445935
 too much i am afraid for what becomes of the moral if our comfort springs from a breach of promise for i ought not to have mentioned the subject      240.20910387244822
 this will never do      266.67016311176104
 you need not distress yourself      40.119101978691035
 the moral will be perfectly fair      1832.2815889285312
 lady catherines unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts      305.5408422155391
 i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude      482.3310718019275
 i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of yours      268.92710540905745
 my aunts intelligence had given me hope and i was determined at once to know every thing      430.86543474926106
 lady catherine has been of infinite use which ought to make her happy for she loves to be of use      293.26819615701015
 was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed      2181.9521316599216
 or had you intended any more serious consequence      44.13999885317416
 my avowed one or what i avowed to myself was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley and if she were to make the confession to him which i have since made      298.24991613119414
 shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to befall her      213.53457391962337
 i am more likely to want time than courage elizabeth      484.1981726112455
 but it ought to be done and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done directly      497.3348769102433
 and if i had not a letter to write myself i might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing as another young lady once did      276.686356286083
 but i have an aunt too who must not be longer neglected      301.75790502886076
 from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr      155.49865049374742
 darcy had been overrated elizabeth had never yet answered mrs      80.82472835959233
 gardiners long letter but now having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness and immediately wrote as follows i would have thanked you before my dear aunt as i ought to have done for your long kind satisfactory detail of particulars but to say the truth i was too cross to write      481.2733417449801
 you supposed more than really existed      149.03516866374105
 but now suppose as much as you chuse give a loose to your fancy indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford and unless you believe me actually married you cannot greatly err      945.6706908490429
 your idea of the ponies is delightful      42.45296161159391
 we will go round the park every day      689.7671678054285
 perhaps other people have said so before but not one with such justice      1611.2638776831805
 i am happier even than jane she only smiles i laugh      429.0268415907225
 darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can spare from me      322.1704577752609
 yours c      40.11910197869102
 darcys letter to lady catherine was in a different style and still different from either was what mr      725.001048403596
 bennet sent to mr      2056.6665453882724
 collins in reply to his last      106.75123397241158
 dear sir i must trouble you once more for congratulations      236.13676515832304
 elizabeth will soon be the wife of mr      902.4873677981599
 console lady catherine as well as you can      621.1055034158809
 but if i were you i would stand by the nephew      588.3906690718753
 he has more to give      193.76542062357612
 yours sincerely c      40.11910197869101
 miss bingleys congratulations to her brother on his approaching marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere      1071.2340324832253
 she wrote even to jane on the occasion to express her delight and repeat all her former professions of regard      873.1690792873802
 jane was not deceived but she was affected and though feeling no reliance on her could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved      767.0772175457274
 the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information was as sincere as her brothers in sending it      655.1613068085777
 four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister      950.1361028778575
 before any answer could arrive from mr      2867.939465423552
 collins or any congratulations to elizabeth from his wife the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge      105.42853317264651
 the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident      1338.4711704261013
 lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephews letter that charlotte really rejoicing in the match was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over      432.4523252953353
 at such a moment the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought when she saw mr      385.4042746592013
 he bore it however with admirable calmness      380.52835234615804
 he could even listen to sir william lucas when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st      447.9405693560166
 jamess with very decent composure      1090.363061731885
 if he did shrug his shoulders it was not till sir william was out of sight      176.9738144917891
 philipss vulgarity was another and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance and though mrs      396.8385269817264
 philips as well as her sister stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingleys good humour encouraged yet whenever she did speak she must be vulgar      1155.3753650625445
 nor was her respect for him though it made her more quiet at all likely to make her more elegant      1278.5138207441692
 elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either and was ever anxious to keep him to herself and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure it added to the hope of the future and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley      478.97887667937124
 bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters      1229.5237429804772
 with what delighted pride she afterwards visited mrs      632.5192817474128
 bingley and talked of mrs      215.01817017506332
 darcy may be guessed      48.56388609578208
 i wish i could say for the sake of her family that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible amiable wellinformed woman for the rest of her life though perhaps it was lucky for her husband who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly      587.625975186152
 bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do      2878.1345929243084
 he delighted in going to pemberley especially when he was least expected      545.7243846566255
 bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth      244.55606762089144
 so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper or her affectionate heart      240.16243490470586
 the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire and jane and elizabeth in addition to every other source of happiness were within thirty miles of each other      783.4218727058469
 kitty to her very material advantage spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters      370.9319288571703
 she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia and removed from the influence of lydias example she became by proper attention and management less irritable less ignorant and less insipid      478.9487679411594
 from the farther disadvantage of lydias society she was of course carefully kept and though mrs      988.9580178250982
 wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her with the promise of balls and young men her father would never consent to her going      529.9514903550165
 mary was the only daughter who remained at home and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs      278.07982142847766
 bennets being quite unable to sit alone      3269.027341569461
 mary was obliged to mix more with the world but she could still moralize over every morning visit and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters beauty and her own it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance      589.56962702553
 as for wickham and lydia their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters      415.7356108624505
 the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage explained to her that by his wife at least if not by himself such a hope was cherished      509.5963791633577
 the letter was to this effect my dear lizzy i wish you joy      2249.3825515360954
 if you love mr      218.78303878412083
 darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham you must be very happy      181.00498898788408
 it is a great comfort to have you so rich and when you have nothing else to do i hope you will think of us      593.3428232525478
 i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help      352.10367618126986
 any place would do of about three or four hundred a year but however do not speak to mr      193.8875715947856
 yours c      40.11910197869102
 as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind      671.644393127151
 such relief however as it was in her power to afford by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences she frequently sent them      730.9009951924975
 it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants and heedless of the future must be very insufficient to their support and whenever they changed their quarters either jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills      540.666150638998
