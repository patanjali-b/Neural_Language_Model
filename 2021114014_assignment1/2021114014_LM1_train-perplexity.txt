 it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife         5.0925247952374395
 however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters         5.355350447520376
 my dear mr         306.2724779413878
 bennet said his lady to him one day have you heard that netherfield park is let at last         7.296430713168737
 bennet replied that he had not         17.362681531959137
 but it is returned she for mrs         16.975629745212004
 long has just been here and she told me all about it         12.256562918344938
 bennet made no answer         111.85234026427132
 cried his wife impatiently         197.4448366119783
 this was invitation enough         107.32435703151154
 long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with mr         3.9636545961983143
 morris immediately that he is to take possession before michaelmas and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week         6.588445036980444
 what is his name         59.057255198343256
 is he married or single         48.62017019304934
 single my dear to be sure         58.880507995005345
 a single man of large fortune four or five thousand a year         10.61716113886706
 what a fine thing for our girls         26.592204472648298
 how can it affect them         49.076193463770075
 my dear mr         306.2724779413878
 bennet replied his wife how can you be so tiresome         8.81285934892862
 you must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them         7.664708047279549
 is that his design in settling here         14.475912324010695
 design         5523.736842105263
 but it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes         4.793052018282372
 i see no occasion for that         18.346598720968128
 you and the girls may go or you may send them by themselves which perhaps will be still better for as you are as handsome as any of them mr         4.889017779186458
 bingley might like you the best of the party         16.4287251532629
 my dear you flatter me         49.38366159786523
 i certainly have had my share of beauty but i do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now         5.1231431829463006
 when a woman has five grown up daughters she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty         8.017622440606273
 in such cases a woman has not often much beauty to think of         12.632894519506344
 but my dear you must indeed go and see mr         13.985989996641152
 bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood         21.061252281696014
 it is more than i engage for i assure you         11.754383176933844
 but consider your daughters         123.7515220913343
 only think what an establishment it would be for one of them         10.842098795891669
 sir william and lady lucas are determined to go merely on that account for in general you know they visit no new comers         6.685589438597079
 indeed you must go for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not         5.122570359603087
 you are over scrupulous surely         50.868962187762214
 i dare say mr         132.04424474228784
 bingley will be very glad to see you and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy         4.5301552293062946
 i desire you will do no such thing         15.142946929482635
 lizzy is not a bit better than the others and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane nor half so good humoured as lydia         4.751678243794778
 they have none of them much to recommend them replied he they are all silly and ignorant like other girls but lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters         6.2955662149911165
 bennet how can you abuse your own children in such a way         12.473587810297087
 you take delight in vexing me         48.38303008402009
 you have no compassion on my poor nerves         16.253449696304926
 you mistake me my dear         66.19008852485793
 they are my old friends         42.69397869759934
 ah         20990.2
 it will be no use to us if twenty such should come since you will not visit them         6.583652210970641
 depend upon it my dear that when there are twenty i will visit them all         11.265888093152869
 bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts sarcastic humour reserve and caprice that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character         5.412367277248898
 her mind was less difficult to develope         19.52608475811383
 she was a woman of mean understanding little information and uncertain temper         7.897456964503937
 when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous         14.416095584619393
 the business of her life was to get her daughters married its solace was visiting and news         6.816297069956151
 chapter ii         13367.620200875554
 bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr         13.378909886417896
 he had always intended to visit him though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it         5.132134861277825
 it was then disclosed in the following manner         12.812207513838855
 observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat he suddenly addressed her with i hope mr         10.922755750746855
 bingley will like it lizzy         69.60409563442343
 we are not in a way to know what mr         13.504290085686687
 bingley likes said her mother resentfully since we are not to visit         15.005424438056664
 but you forget mama said elizabeth that we shall meet him at the assemblies and that mrs         8.65522337590244
 long has promised to introduce him         61.51520595328444
 i do not believe mrs         20.933189198227936
 long will do any such thing         41.16544146495775
 she has two nieces of her own         23.7350050005784
 she is a selfish hypocritical woman and i have no opinion of her         7.806810964144042
 bennet and i am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you         6.253886358489704
 have a little compassion on my nerves         19.572976217110362
 you tear them to pieces         84.60555492886611
 kitty has no discretion in her coughs said her father she times them ill         10.89763153235026
 i do not cough for my own amusement replied kitty fretfully         10.883434288293776
 when is your next ball to be lizzy         17.5989735234711
 aye so it is cried her mother and mrs         18.08284403017695
 long does not come back till the day before so it will be impossible for her to introduce him for she will not know him herself         5.297970311260864
 then my dear you may have the advantage of your friend and introduce mr         9.352778464105379
 bingley to her         79.20506446505226
 impossible mr         705.9837047861142
 bennet impossible when i am not acquainted with him myself how can you be so teazing         7.634638435938382
 i honour your circumspection         111.86769814343418
 one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight         7.782829637221927
 but if we do not venture somebody else will and after all mrs         10.211449158362765
 the girls stared at their father         58.952636383620415
 bennet said only nonsense nonsense         52.50855551605243
 what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation         8.655295722343743
 cried he         399.358654944074
 do you consider the forms of introduction and the stress that is laid on them as nonsense         8.73250874472281
 i cannot quite agree with you there         29.024633557470153
 what say you mary         97.2933006049442
 for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know and read great books and make extracts         7.111567935820311
 while mary is adjusting her ideas he continued let us return to mr         12.767376372476516
 i am sick of mr         85.471269127166
 bingley cried his wife         100.75786522885497
 i am sorry to hear that but why did not you tell me so before         8.171288616002249
 if i had known as much this morning i certainly would not have called on him         7.033331901997595
 it is very unlucky but as i have actually paid the visit we cannot escape the acquaintance now         7.07803066269139
 the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished that of mrs         8.221208643707712
 bennet perhaps surpassing the rest though when the first tumult of joy was over she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while         7.944895956000749
 how good it was in you my dear mr         15.154451081220708
 but i knew i should persuade you at last         16.238220499058976
 i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance         9.410403402520268
 well how pleased i am         86.95445702391197
 now kitty you may cough as much as you chuse said mr         8.637587486769117
 what an excellent father you have girls said she when the door was shut         11.549936857602441
 i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness or me either for that matter         5.193923572882534
 at our time of life it is not so pleasant i can tell you to be making new acquaintance every day but for your sakes we would do any thing         5.8613438960193385
 lydia my love though you are the youngest i dare say mr         11.267052740774778
 bingley will dance with you at the next ball         17.949893035853155
 said lydia stoutly i am not afraid for though i am the youngest im the tallest         11.244146641685065
 the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return mr         4.320814321532029
 bennets visit and determining when they should ask him to dinner         13.8027922276983
 chapter iii         13367.620200875554
 bennet however with the assistance of her five daughters could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of mr         6.074022006316212
 they attacked him in various ways with barefaced questions ingenious suppositions and distant surmises but he eluded the skill of them all and they were at last obliged to accept the secondhand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas         6.045577088585779
 sir william had been delighted with him         44.60315400673339
 he was quite young wonderfully handsome extremely agreeable and to crown the whole he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party         5.367887187872111
 nothing could be more delightful         50.29563852866017
 bingleys heart were entertained         204.32394159767853
 if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield said mrs         8.132194338024856
 bennet to her husband and all the others equally well married i shall have nothing to wish for         6.307679652702165
 in a few days mr         31.867263365203176
 bingley returned mr         388.2323009641615
 he had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies of whose beauty he had heard much but he saw only the father         6.121889733162595
 the ladies were somewhat more fortunate for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse         5.596827227255978
 an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched and already had mrs         9.611194091657788
 bingley was obliged to be in town the following day and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation c         6.948357167616976
 bennet was quite disconcerted         98.33251806101701
 she could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another and never settled at netherfield as he ought to be         4.248791759595901
 lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball and a report soon followed that mr         6.494197473961207
 bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly         7.463004495991463
 and when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether mr         6.684765804126188
 bingley his two sisters the husband of the eldest and another young man         10.287876135812043
 bingley was good looking and gentlemanlike he had a pleasant countenance and easy unaffected manners         8.76544873175712
 hurst merely looked the gentleman but his friend mr         29.576828156339076
 darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine tall person handsome features noble mien and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance of his having ten thousand a year         5.384546667360578
 the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr         6.963428074113175
 bingley and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity for he was discovered to be proud to be above his company and above being pleased and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding disagreeable countenance and being unworthy to be compared with his friend         4.31223375136303
 such amiable qualities must speak for themselves         51.763015119470815
 what a contrast between him and his friend         33.674893185860434
 darcy danced only once with mrs         56.870930009412355
 his character was decided         71.80899894231595
 he was the proudest most disagreeable man in the world and every body hoped that he would never come there again         3.7503439569520842
 amongst the most violent against him was mrs         25.61207757330454
 bennet whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters         8.80322352946733
 elizabeth bennet had been obliged by the scarcity of gentlemen to sit down for two dances and during part of that time mr         6.645595441298499
 bingley who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it         6.912502762055663
 i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner         10.173457067073487
 you had much better dance         35.44144793042037
 i certainly shall not         117.38076712815807
 you know how i detest it unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner         10.058424256805367
 at such an assembly as this it would be insupportable         13.397656602913692
 your sisters are engaged and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with         5.189188523142615
 i would not be so fastidious as you are cried bingley for a kingdom         8.137874785309485
 upon my honour i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as i have this evening and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty         5.117697143842533
 you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room said mr         11.549412470601878
 darcy looking at the eldest miss bennet         21.266701255525884
 she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld         10.102135554061592
 but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you who is very pretty and i dare say very agreeable         5.226941206937042
 do let me ask my partner to introduce you         17.88399107583032
 you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles for you are wasting your time with me         7.227135299998418
 darcy walked off and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him         13.352401162712324
 she told the story however with great spirit among her friends for she had a lively playful disposition which delighted in any thing ridiculous         6.044286751908621
 the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family         18.01305704246457
 bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party         12.228399007246907
 bingley had danced with her twice and she had been distinguished by his sisters         7.824395732663056
 jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be though in a quieter way         7.141197176102007
 mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball         5.286647841172816
 they returned therefore in good spirits to longbourn the village where they lived and of which they were the principal inhabitants         7.726812190757166
 my dear mr         306.2724779413878
 bennet as she entered the room we have had a most delightful evening a most excellent ball         5.925969912964603
 i wish you had been there         10.850001539012466
 every body said how well she looked and mr         22.01994774037835
 bingley thought her quite beautiful and danced with her twice         10.29040047739203
 only think of that my dear he actually danced with her twice and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time         4.293420996675469
 first of all he asked miss lucas         18.033303137756054
 i was so vexed to see him stand up with her but however he did not admire her at all indeed nobody can you know and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance         4.5279077341851455
 so he enquired who she was and got introduced and asked her for the two next         9.683902784433208
 then the two third he danced with miss king and the two fourth with maria lucas and the two fifth with jane again and the two sixth with lizzy and the boulanger if he had had any compassion for me cried her husband impatiently he would not have danced half so much         4.723088931337811
 for gods sake say no more of his partners         37.36845446313411
 that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance         10.343303744600227
 my dear continued mrs         193.31025562349103
 bennet i am quite delighted with him         24.10158436048491
 he is so excessively handsome         31.917680880166284
 and his sisters are charming women         24.232471160927936
 i never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses         4.728434420336371
 i dare say the lace upon mrs         36.54729780224006
 hursts gown here she was interrupted again         88.8074817709734
 bennet protested against any description of finery         46.79360847210312
 but i can assure you she added that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy for he is a most disagreeable horrid man not at all worth pleasing         4.617078068144072
 so high and so conceited that there was no enduring him         9.55374898177528
 he walked here and he walked there fancying himself so very great         13.341576251353803
 not handsome enough to dance with         22.95358086063848
 i wish you had been there my dear to have given him one of your set downs         5.560632704014364
 when jane and elizabeth were alone the former who had been cautious in her praise of mr         6.626085358902216
 bingley before expressed to her sister how very much she admired him         12.026361459933948
 he is just what a young man ought to be said she sensible good humoured lively and i never saw such happy manners         5.54790133525729
so much ease with such perfect good breeding         26.58344712931239
 he is also handsome replied elizabeth which a young man ought likewise to be if he possibly can         7.337802418803824
 his character is thereby complete         47.20541262101526
 i did not expect such a compliment         14.928882507636985
 did not you         194.57328680882182
 i did for you         54.25255965003445
 but that is one great difference between us         13.571812302588096
 compliments always take you by surprise and me never         29.6554032934107
 what could be more natural than his asking you again         12.577939840426577
 he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room         5.501666416528364
 no thanks to his gallantry for that         23.121371512442426
 well he certainly is very agreeable and i give you leave to like him         10.201045469198176
 you have liked many a stupider person         28.330532748447194
 dear lizzy         870.293222044986
 you are a great deal too apt you know to like people in general         7.1750559228851305
 you never see a fault in any body         20.444690715628322
 all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes         14.419838025945666
 i would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one but i always speak what i think         7.6776949582091865
 i know you do and it is that which makes the wonder         9.947860559360207
 with your good sense to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others         8.043083122691137
 affectation of candour is common enoughone meets it every where         27.3886932553394
 but to be candid without ostentation or designto take the good of every bodys character and make it still better and say nothing of the badbelongs to you alone         5.202626008935232
 their manners are not equal to his         29.623786203319824
 but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them         11.491997508943
 elizabeth listened in silence but was not convinced their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself she was very little disposed to approve them         4.84051758345976
 they were in fact very fine ladies not deficient in good humour when they were pleased nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it but proud and conceited         5.120939421028308
 they were rather handsome had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds were in the habit of spending more than they ought and of associating with people of rank and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves and meanly of others         4.116794248690555
 they were of a respectable family in the north of england a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brothers fortune and their own had been acquired by trade         4.970722196708295
 bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father who had intended to purchase an estate but did not live to do it         8.273220837070195
mr         193.63653136531366
 his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own but though he was now established only as a tenant miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table nor was mrs         4.7860658844765585
 hurst who had married a man of more fashion than fortune less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her         6.949243784216925
 bingley had not been of age two years when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house         6.7066675574696815
 he did look at it and into it for half an hour was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms satisfied with what the owner said in its praise and took it immediately         5.212838120176315
 between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship in spite of a great opposition of character         6.752572257894408
 in understanding darcy was the superior         39.76072212116369
 bingley was by no means deficient but darcy was clever         7.435835096875476
 he was at the same time haughty reserved and fastidious and his manners though well bred were not inviting         4.362897884553642
 in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage         15.09804712903887
 the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic         6.990592999679871
 bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life every body had been most kind and attentive to him there had been no formality no stiffness he had soon felt acquainted with all the room and as to miss bennet he could not conceive an angel more beautiful         4.826022336555721
 darcy on the contrary had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest and from none received either attention or pleasure         4.97120340230329
 miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty but she smiled too much         12.99978017448374
 hurst and her sister allowed it to be sobut still they admired her and liked her and pronounced her to be a sweet girl and one whom they should not object to know more of         4.386457094833606
 miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose         6.5745650682369865
 within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate         10.395730776997857
 sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty         6.999387731001446
 the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly         20.28316849449113
 for though elated by his rank it did not render him supercilious on the contrary he was all attention to every body         8.243059978677882
 by nature inoffensive friendly and obliging his presentation at st         25.630769970039278
 jamess had made him courteous         98.64807184813093
they had several children         125.68836357101281
 the eldest of them a sensible intelligent young woman about twentyseven was elizabeths intimate friend         8.238195972996255
 that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate         5.038114285041793
 you began the evening well charlotte said mrs         14.563706465370217
 bennet with civil selfcommand to miss lucas         29.92204430391234
 you were mr         121.19604514938507
 bingleys first choice         1791.8685238739208
 yesbut he seemed to like his second better         35.553214062805274
you mean jane i supposebecause he danced with her twice         12.216275274133194
 to be sure that did seem as if he admired herindeed i rather believe he didi heard something about itbut i hardly know whatsomething about mr         6.426839850204526
 robinson         52475.5
 perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr         18.295665024332287
 robinson did not i mention it to you         31.99844768425862
 robinsons asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room and which he thought the prettiest         7.3060171515602175
 and his answering immediately to the last questionoh         21.57908113370774
 the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt there cannot be two opinions on that point         8.715699354130578
well that was very decided indeedthat does seem as ifbut however it may all come to nothing you know         6.696908210861782
 my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours eliza said charlotte         16.414533454596075
poor eliza         3570.587302927314
 i beg you would not put it into lizzys head to be vexed by his illtreatment for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him         5.004419302476937
 long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips         6.944958613941622
 are you quite sure maam         37.79434159128984
is not there a little mistake         26.489159704930202
 said jane         416.11081851411154
i certainly saw mr         127.26176292004187
 darcy speaking to her         83.78622647321404
 ayebecause she asked him at last how he liked netherfield and he could not help answering herbut she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to         7.106147517485007
 with them he is remarkably agreeable         22.065703333041014
 i do not believe a word of it my dear         7.61476522277151
 if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to mrs         6.437786000853451
 long         1039.118811881188
 but i can guess how it was every body says that he is ate up with pride and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs         4.881669093538999
 long does not keep a carriage and had come to the ball in a hack chaise         9.379022287981138
 i do not mind his not talking to mrs         13.349590116885603
 another time lizzy said her mother i would not dance with him if i were you         8.876599577008763
 his pride said miss lucas does not offend me so much as pride often does because there is an excuse for it         7.008328226410695
 one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man with family fortune every thing in his favour should think highly of himself         8.003219970821133
 if i may so express it he has a right to be proud         10.129041628815731
 that is very true replied elizabeth and i could easily forgive his pride if he had not mortified mine         5.415198760059963
 pride observed mary who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections is a very common failing i believe         10.331250628508368
 vanity and pride are different things though the words are often used synonimously         12.496072486839163
 a person may be proud without being vain         21.769569314469244
 pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves vanity to what we would have others think of us         10.719550619831532
 if i were as rich as mr         20.226605414798247
 darcy cried a young lucas who came with his sisters i should not care how proud i was         7.078425156986091
 i would keep a pack of foxhounds and drink a bottle of wine every day         9.402938990897411
 then you would drink a great deal more than you ought said mrs         6.500904185529077
 bennet and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly         7.277779464405915
 the boy protested that she should not she continued to declare that she would and the argument ended only with the visit         7.942591972013926
 the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield         10.663148855046046
 the visit was returned in due form         17.944103434129506
 hurst and miss bingley and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to a wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the two eldest         4.7890458768169
 by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body hardly excepting even her sister and could not like them though their kindness to jane such as it was had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brothers admiration         4.712709723750663
 she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas         13.077062672881514
 it may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte to be able to impose on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded         4.941115105187303
 there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself         6.618000780768541
 we can all begin freelya slight preference is natural enough but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement         5.9494855392757655
 in nine cases out of ten a woman had better shew more affection than she feels         13.121805661984078
 bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but he may never do more than like her if she does not help him on         7.618541340332263
 but she does help him on as much as her nature will allow         10.134000953862417
 if i can perceive her regard for him he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too         7.503777777756362
 remember eliza that he does not know janes disposition as you do         13.552580038118577
 but if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavour to conceal it he must find it out         6.3322956505161665
 perhaps he must if he sees enough of her         16.87012420421024
 but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often it is never for many hours together and as they always see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together         5.2601275332083475
 jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention         8.389516082150154
 when she is secure of him there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses         6.430664572060274
 but these are not janes feelings she is not acting by design         11.923306280220507
 as yet she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness         7.273750511278527
 she has known him only a fortnight         26.641396535653794
 she danced four dances with him at meryton she saw him one morning at his own house and has since dined in company with him four times         6.584070688094967
 this is not quite enough to make her understand his character         7.589211830839625
 not as you represent it         22.894695163399263
 had she merely dined with him she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent togetherand four evenings may do a great deal         5.563776293312758
 well said charlotte i wish jane success with all my heart and if she were married to him tomorrow i should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth         4.545853264075214
 happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance         18.538112057982385
 if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand it does not advance their felicity in the least         7.164427033102597
 they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life         5.390844277808863
 you make me laugh charlotte but it is not sound         9.229781458061542
 you know it is not sound and that you would never act in this way yourself         7.094386698071287
 occupied in observing mr         358.41102225088963
 bingleys attentions to her sister elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend         5.931216932840854
 but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes         4.87231733207888
 to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying         23.321428415636806
 though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world he was caught by their easy playfulness         4.26500197614422
 of this she was perfectly unawareto her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with         4.731559986387474
 he began to wish to know more of her and as a step towards conversing with her himself attended to her conversation with others         5.274734180220137
 his doing so drew her notice         33.963804913852954
 it was at sir william lucass where a large party were assembled         8.627804936379667
 that is a question which mr         11.077589188661486
 but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about         6.74519066785804
 he has a very satirical eye and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself i shall soon grow afraid of him         5.711997788571348
 on his approaching them soon afterwards though without seeming to have any intention of speaking miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it she turned to him and said did not you think mr         4.958167352200582
 darcy that i expressed myself uncommonly well just now when i was teazing colonel forster to give us a ball at meryton         6.124605084988058
 with great energybut it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic         17.034486100745216
 you are severe on us         83.26371839393047
 it will be her turn soon to be teazed said miss lucas         9.684314396245036
 you are a very strange creature by way of a friend         9.777993611653502
always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body         13.285130605543337
if my vanity had taken a musical turn you would have been invaluable but as it is i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers         5.1029568321721825
 on miss lucass persevering however she added very well if it must be so it must         8.693733760085985
 and gravely glancing at mr         162.11777259200392
 after a song or two and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary who having in consequence of being the only plain one in the family worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments was always impatient for display         4.834397912832946
 mary had neither genius nor taste and though vanity had given her application it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached         5.936495595625346
 elizabeth easy and unaffected had been listened to with much more pleasure though not playing half so well and mary at the end of a long concerto was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs at the request of her younger sisters who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room         4.105221966523977
 darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening to the exclusion of all conversation and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour till sir william thus began         5.489259179343119
 what a charming amusement for young people this is mr         15.510173485387769
i consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies         7.693621074331988
 certainly sirand it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world         10.061083837582213
every savage can dance         499.79758575873836
 sir william only smiled         389.00370666508695
 you saw me dance at meryton i believe sir         15.776049483970375
 yes indeed and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight         13.914834866729228
 do you often dance at st         36.31835350367209
 jamess         17491.833333333332
 do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place         6.820924768681342
 it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it         6.990254794685341
 you have a house in town i conclude         10.99566278924863
 darcy bowed         2488.045836407072
 i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myselffor i am fond of superior society but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady lucas         5.339590102833455
 he paused in hopes of an answer but his companion was not disposed to make any and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing and called out to her my dear miss eliza why are not you dancing         4.937238924782445
mr         193.63653136531366
 darcy you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner         7.7576095509028455
you cannot refuse to dance i am sure when so much beauty is before you         11.598001137708387
 and taking her hand he would have given it to mr         10.318402155819266
 darcy who though extremely surprised was not unwilling to receive it when she instantly drew back and said with some discomposure to sir william indeed sir i have not the least intention of dancing         5.329416997675862
i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner         8.233404458854974
 darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand but in vain         9.570891440485356
 you excel so much in the dance miss eliza that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general he can have no objection i am sure to oblige us for one half hour         5.041070096268135
 darcy is all politeness said elizabeth smiling         20.90739607659429
 he is indeedbut considering the inducement my dear miss eliza we cannot wonder at his complaisance for who would object to such a partner         7.520045917557565
 elizabeth looked archly and turned away         84.80181463144395
 her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman and he was thinking of her with some complacency when thus accosted by miss bingley i can guess the subject of your reverie         6.000836699812389
 i should imagine not         147.19860164845062
 you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this mannerin such society and indeed i am quite of your opinion         6.910385358723851
 i was never more annoyed         24.254697958749066
 the insipidity and yet the noise the nothingness and yet the selfimportance of all these people         8.888803797419225
 your conjecture is totally wrong i assure you         24.739903771039017
 my mind was more agreeably engaged         31.13858282874105
 i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow         6.240217773790425
 miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections         7.4584198017968095
 darcy replied with great intrepidity miss elizabeth bennet         18.250452163465297
 miss elizabeth bennet         573.7977682041375
 repeated miss bingley         1030.0089726112124
 i am all astonishment         93.0479990497237
 that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask         11.309763431933435
 a ladys imagination is very rapid it jumps from admiration to love from love to matrimony in a moment         10.197118650148145
 i knew you would be wishing me joy         17.529641078791958
 nay if you are so serious about it i shall consider the matter as absolutely settled         9.831521900191497
 you will have a charming motherinlaw indeed and of course she will be always at pemberley with you         7.217870316838613
 he listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to entertain herself in this manner and as his composure convinced her that all was safe her wit flowed long         5.386557816206845
 chapter vii         14675.902278985472
 bennets property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year which unfortunately for his daughters was entailed in default of heirs male on a distant relation and their mothers fortune though ample for her situation in life could but ill supply the deficiency of his         6.141098687437234
 her father had been an attorney in meryton and had left her four thousand pounds         6.890719798195487
 she had a sister married to a mr         11.992065285750842
 philips who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of trade         6.092681726580907
 the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton a most convenient distance for the young ladies who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliners shop just over the way         4.807936731788311
 the two youngest of the family catherine and lydia were particularly frequent in these attentions their minds were more vacant than their sisters and when nothing better offered a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening and however bare of news the country in general might be they always contrived to learn some from their aunt         4.804361648909961
 at present indeed they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood it was to remain the whole winter and meryton was the head quarters         5.766697351045624
 their visits to mrs         116.65150743811076
 every day added something to their knowledge of the officers names and connections         12.711435228391533
 their lodgings were not long a secret and at length they began to know the officers themselves         9.574065930575056
 philips visited them all and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before         12.072358385410084
 after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject mr         17.926245280351377
 bennet coolly observed from all that i can collect by your manner of talking you must be two of the silliest girls in the country         7.521184930691235
 i have suspected it some time but i am now convinced         14.997818235376448
 i am astonished my dear said mrs         33.68791815947839
 bennet that you should be so ready to think your own children silly         7.739324359713953
 if i wished to think slightingly of any bodys children it should not be of my own however         7.5959278243165205
 if my children are silly i must hope to be always sensible of it         10.913404034686314
 yesbut as it happens they are all of them very clever         14.794775493187874
 this is the only point i flatter myself on which we do not agree         7.785551212552402
 i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish         6.383585129558653
 my dear mr         306.2724779413878
 bennet you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother         8.105664623192986
when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do         8.064775801730592
 i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very welland indeed so i do still at my heart and if a smart young colonel with five or six thousand a year should want one of my girls i shall not say nay to him and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir williams in his regimentals         4.386270904234957
 mama cried lydia my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss watsons as they did when they first came she sees them now very often standing in clarkes library         6.499274431534122
 bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet it came from netherfield and the servant waited for an answer         4.34492890260831
 bennets eyes sparkled with pleasure and she was eagerly calling out while her daughter read well jane who is it from         10.793153643423974
 what is it about         57.71420039577543
 it is from miss bingley said jane and then read it aloud         9.289963803056692
 my dear friend if you are not so compassionate as to dine today with louisa and me we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives for a whole days têteàtête between two women can never end without a quarrel         4.919320728633616
 come as soon as you can on the receipt of this         8.168071463098636
 my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers         9.160195346386825
 yours ever caroline bingley         486.17761274033467
 with the officers         263.45628793260096
 dining out said mrs         275.2092872313749
 can i have the carriage         38.44079902775962
 said jane         416.11081851411154
 no my dear you had better go on horseback because it seems likely to rain and then you must stay all night         6.569838313269622
 that would be a good scheme said elizabeth if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home         5.951523953452252
 but the gentlemen will have mr         31.209139543383984
 bingleys chaise to go to meryton and the hursts have no horses to theirs         10.229892202623647
 i had much rather go in the coach         14.71953909054418
 but my dear your father cannot spare the horses i am sure         11.345712323282651
 they are wanted in the farm mr         32.87569242228358
 but if you have got them today said elizabeth my mothers purpose will be answered         8.167371811049684
 she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged         8.061994338314268
 jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day         6.137403690768963
 her hopes were answered jane had not been gone long before it rained hard         9.792465091191724
 her sisters were uneasy for her but her mother was delighted         11.473766053653964
 the rain continued the whole evening without intermission jane certainly could not come back         12.18764238505647
 this was a lucky idea of mine indeed         10.48222368898183
 said mrs         396.447886151016
 till the next morning however she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance         8.183006170868685
 breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth my dearest lizzy i find myself very unwell this morning which i suppose is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday         5.453748966091523
 my kind friends will not hear of my returning home till i am better         10.16582039241704
 they insist also on my seeing mr         47.50927592353307
 jonestherefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to meand excepting a sorethroat and headache there is not much the matter with me         6.820412376069725
 well my dear said mr         46.635385336717846
 bennet when elizabeth had read the note aloud if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness if she should die it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr         4.70580525472388
 bingley and under your orders         49.62284969034598
 i am not at all afraid of her dying         12.77301146823097
 people do not die of little trifling colds         23.098787266774053
 she will be taken good care of         18.148092339000623
 as long as she stays there it is all very well         9.62970130619137
 i would go and see her if i could have the carriage         10.732271197816496
 elizabeth feeling really anxious was determined to go to her though the carriage was not to be had and as she was no horsewoman walking was her only alternative         5.19598585639562
 she declared her resolution         78.84775982495945
 how can you be so silly cried her mother as to think of such a thing in all this dirt         5.45039569563481
 you will not be fit to be seen when you get there         8.486103063979803
 is this a hint to me lizzy said her father to send for the horses         6.808074349851321
 no indeed         405.310152910733
 i do not wish to avoid the walk         15.532208545707533
 i shall be back by dinner         28.63517468776015
 i admire the activity of your benevolence observed mary but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason and in my opinion exertion should always be in proportion to what is required         5.512807683090035
elizabeth accepted their company and the three young ladies set off together         9.704955187258356
 if we make haste said lydia as they walked along perhaps we may see something of captain carter before he goes         7.170782193128829
 in meryton they parted the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers wives and elizabeth continued her walk alone crossing field after field at a quick pace jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity and finding herself at last within view of the house with weary ancles dirty stockings and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise         4.550171480013309
 she was shewn into the breakfastparlour where all but jane were assembled and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise         6.295786078824979
that she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such dirty weather and by herself was almost incredible to mrs         6.089384523345858
 hurst and miss bingley and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it         5.158072393653954
 she was received however very politely by them and in their brothers manners there was something better than politeness there was good humour and kindness         6.1808307707022125
mr         193.63653136531366
 darcy said very little and mr         29.6065372326702
 hurst nothing at all         151.67774080637685
 the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to the occasions justifying her coming so far alone         5.73960476184223
 the latter was thinking only of his breakfast         19.698725086554155
 her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered         16.089887092301954
 miss bennet had slept ill and though up was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room         8.334892197440642
 elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately and jane who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit was delighted at her entrance         5.299921248764334
 she was not equal however to much conversation and when miss bingley left them together could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with         5.272732242297671
 when breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters and elizabeth began to like them herself when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for jane         5.757282074079616
 the apothecary came and having examined his patient said as might be supposed that she had caught a violent cold and that they must endeavour to get the better of it advised her to return to bed and promised her some draughts         5.235473810751883
 the advice was followed readily for the feverish symptoms increased and her head ached acutely         8.341958736816068
 elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment nor were the other ladies often absent the gentlemen being out they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere         5.598480224635829
 when the clock struck three elizabeth felt that she must go and very unwillingly said so         11.534716442091392
 miss bingley offered her the carriage and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it when jane testified such concern in parting with her that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present         5.004081018147042
 elizabeth most thankfully consented and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes         8.073915578028869
 at five oclock the two ladies retired to dress and at half past six elizabeth was summoned to dinner         8.983011471991063
 bingleys she could not make a very favourable answer         16.34130639900695
 jane was by no means better         14.742815226770032
 the sisters on hearing this repeated three or four times how much they were grieved how shocking it was to have a bad cold and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves and then thought no more of the matter and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike         4.280776548735643
 their brother indeed was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency         8.664848640596787
 his anxiety for jane was evident and his attentions to herself most pleasing and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others         5.655506918215776
 she had very little notice from any but him         10.619355292410837
 darcy her sister scarcely less so and as for mr         13.03197655183227
 hurst by whom elizabeth sat he was an indolent man who lived only to eat drink and play at cards who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout had nothing to say to her         5.076260245370234
 when dinner was over she returned directly to jane and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room         5.045054452625805
 her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed a mixture of pride and impertinence she had no conversation no style no taste no beauty         5.651608675211392
 hurst thought the same and added she has nothing in short to recommend her but being an excellent walker         7.905545419679786
 i shall never forget her appearance this morning         15.937939880702832
 she really looked almost wild         63.66397975793617
 she did indeed louisa         105.45865153956984
 i could hardly keep my countenance         36.17179783334727
 very nonsensical to come at all         42.85383111595293
 why must she be scampering about the country because her sister had a cold         9.98555590371999
 her hair so untidy so blowsy         45.42427864774684
 yes and her petticoat i hope you saw her petticoat six inches deep in mud i am absolutely certain and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office         5.239791545363403
 your picture may be very exact louisa said bingley but this was all lost upon me         10.417327506499262
 i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning         7.829406816081935
 you observed it mr         76.43746352959373
 darcy i am sure said miss bingley and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition         3.410314907892691
 certainly not         436.7216813585295
 to walk three miles or four miles or five miles or whatever it is above her ancles in dirt and alone quite alone         7.01853410238956
 what could she mean by it         24.35598486549225
 it seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence a most country town indifference to decorum         7.091885570650374
 i am afraid mr         208.39439347995668
 darcy observed miss bingley in a half whisper that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes         7.528025362315426
 not at all he replied they were brightened by the exercise         9.810330828793937
a short pause followed this speech and mrs         30.59231489547147
 hurst began again         1015.5125696388305
 i have an excessive regard for jane bennet she is really a very sweet girl and i wish with all my heart she were well settled         4.540911534737011
 but with such a father and mother and such low connections i am afraid there is no chance of it         5.990681069492463
 i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in meryton         3.9024324792467358
 yes and they have another who lives somewhere near cheapside         12.787733647381332
 that is capital added her sister and they both laughed heartily         15.764557800184908
 if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside cried bingley it would not make them one jot less agreeable         7.068410744182766
 with a renewal of tenderness however they repaired to her room on leaving the diningparlour and sat with her till summoned to coffee         7.010570329486041
 on entering the drawingroom she found the whole party at loo and was immediately invited to join them but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it and making her sister the excuse said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book         4.993433264943384
 hurst looked at her with astonishment         34.46173666513494
 do you prefer reading to cards         55.18046548184912
 said he that is rather singular         22.28621955270263
 miss eliza bennet said miss bingley despises cards         33.83772969818564
 she is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else         6.198186880076228
 i deserve neither such praise nor such censure cried elizabeth i am not a great reader and i have pleasure in many things         6.917904565368501
 in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure said bingley and i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well         5.477270754261855
 elizabeth thanked him from her heart and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying         8.788449515902341
 he immediately offered to fetch her others all that his library afforded         14.24030236535454
 and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit but i am an idle fellow and though i have not many i have more than i ever look into         5.077183116989639
 elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room         10.131800717318514
what a delightful library you have at pemberley mr         18.13016912507167
 it ought to be good he replied it has been the work of many generations         6.1358250729858215
 and then you have added so much to it yourself you are always buying books         7.707583131982028
 i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these         11.294716025421915
 neglect         13118.875
 charles when you build your house i wish it may be half as delightful as pemberley         9.197254128087666
 i wish it may         43.55466275072557
 but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood and take pemberley for a kind of model         6.338136286677862
 there is not a finer county in england than derbyshire         10.784643416625752
 with all my heart i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it         7.189149533595382
 upon my word caroline i should think it more possible to get pemberley by purchase than by imitation         9.630480965077828
 elizabeth was so much caught by what passed as to leave her very little attention for her book and soon laying it wholly aside she drew near the cardtable and stationed herself between mr         5.219702626865148
 bingley and his eldest sister to observe the game         11.134004349203114
 is miss darcy much grown since the spring         20.452776592956003
 i think she will         41.54665648509946
 she is now about miss elizabeth bennets height or rather taller         11.150160488490913
 how i long to see her again         23.493611756538495
 i never met with anybody who delighted me so much         13.988762674699979
 such a countenance such manners         58.00770773056454
 and so extremely accomplished for her age         24.213821488795304
 her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite         26.356588396517726
 it is amazing to me said bingley how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are         7.455299652207416
 all young ladies accomplished         167.91497184006533
 my dear charles what do you mean         33.51904120878818
 yes all of them i think         27.370770699822106
 they all paint tables cover skreens and net purses         29.535192883814453
 i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time without being informed that she was very accomplished         4.25582858638982
 your list of the common extent of accomplishments said darcy has too much truth         10.605084612290774
 the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a skreen         6.700541967924051
 but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general         7.289265420084616
 i cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished         7.465547616593075
 nor i i am sure said miss bingley         7.624720118258422
 then observed elizabeth you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman         8.161094142070239
 yes i do comprehend a great deal in it         12.03439340728044
 certainly cried his faithful assistant no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with         7.467904654492599
 a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word and besides all this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the word will be but half deserved         4.506795030526804
 all this she must possess added darcy and to all this she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading         4.35250354289017
 i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women         11.750883724883913
 are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this         7.670369744134089
 i never saw such a woman         19.175708539458
 i never saw such capacity and taste and application and elegance as you describe united         7.990638373468656
 hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description when mr         5.477271034980296
 hurst called them to order with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward         8.503510706016312
 but in my opinion it is a paltry device a very mean art         8.088698516637818
 whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable         124.29054102703826
 miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject         9.154673005600648
 joness being sent for immediately while his sisters convinced that no country advice could be of any service recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians         7.3350720032199686
 this she would not hear of but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brothers proposal and it was settled that mr         4.01953496839125
 jones should be sent for early in the morning if miss bennet were not decidedly better         11.327106003592828
 they solaced their wretchedness however by duets after supper while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister         6.111241492282078
 chapter ix         14675.902278985472
 elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sisters room and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from mr         4.243548580664725
 bingley by a housemaid and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters         6.93144434538053
 in spite of this amendment however she requested to have a note sent to longbourn desiring her mother to visit jane and form her own judgment of her situation         6.142601290874235
 the note was immediately dispatched and its contents as quickly complied with         10.579990815612513
 bennet accompanied by her two youngest girls reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast         11.68012963346593
 had she found jane in any apparent danger mrs         15.090897876732013
 bennet would have been very miserable but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming she had no wish of her recovering immediately as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield         5.145074918220692
 she would not listen therefore to her daughters proposal of being carried home neither did the apothecary who arrived about the same time think it at all advisable         5.620103551122498
 bingley met them with hopes that mrs         30.09131698485789
 bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected         12.290101790812434
 indeed i have sir was her answer         22.380733443498826
 she is a great deal too ill to be moved         6.705358663701588
 jones says we must not think of moving her         37.932611425304415
 removed         8073.153846153847
 it must not be thought of         24.50873316881951
 my sister i am sure will not hear of her removal         8.601346058815293
 you may depend upon it madam said miss bingley with cold civility that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us         6.433843681119269
 bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments         76.31324415669222
 i am sure she added if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her for she is very ill indeed and suffers a vast deal though with the greatest patience in the world which is always the way with her for she has without exception the sweetest temper i ever met with         3.978896863294444
 i often tell my other girls they are nothing to her         13.841633728442783
 you have a sweet room here mr         16.21646269948106
 bingley and a charming prospect over that gravel walk         11.00129701107667
 i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield         6.447137399745717
 you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope though you have but a short lease         6.88600737647114
 whatever i do is done in a hurry replied he and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield i should probably be off in five minutes         6.474126866423645
 at present however i consider myself as quite fixed here         16.822565403250934
 that is exactly what i should have supposed of you said elizabeth         8.191331513240105
 cried he turning towards her         97.50396682152693
 yesi understand you perfectly         488.9493612770193
 that is as it happens         27.294804451075173
 it does not necessarily follow that a deep intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours         6.477852679043371
 lizzy cried her mother remember where you are and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home         6.587151069691989
 i did not know before continued bingley immediately that you were a studier of character         5.870100296911648
 it must be an amusing study         25.1841681277578
 they have at least that advantage         25.26923120952399
 but people themselves alter so much that there is something new to be observed in them for ever         9.124346516327103
 yes indeed cried mrs         243.12304130679212
 bennet offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood         16.868591720263396
 i assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town         5.664269870982082
 every body was surprised and darcy after looking at her for a moment turned silently away         9.603056763057097
 bennet who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him continued her triumph         12.894047854029168
 i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part except the shops and public places         7.411413766935929
 the country is a vast deal pleasanter is not it mr         12.270294940547117
 when i am in the country he replied i never wish to leave it and when i am in town it is pretty much the same         4.991583142804719
 they have each their advantages and i can be equally happy in either         11.036783207179514
 ayethat is because you have the right disposition         39.97988253403058
 indeed mama you are mistaken said elizabeth blushing for her mother         17.641866729224798
 you quite mistook mr         458.5910433002559
 he only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town which you must acknowledge to be true         4.987801463044982
 certainly my dear nobody said there were but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger         7.037681231114159
 i know we dine with four and twenty families         16.433622498920435
 nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance         13.146998510854058
 darcy with a very expressive smile         20.725551826518554
 elizabeth for the sake of saying something that might turn her mothers thoughts now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since her coming away         4.7381345793674665
 yes she called yesterday with her father         32.74267174986609
 what an agreeable man sir william is mr         23.270382841393044
 bingleyis not he         838.4158648447934
 so much the man of fashion         21.313519671926628
 so genteel and so easy         59.729595705162666
he has always something to say to every body         13.882977775163162
that is my idea of good breeding and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter         5.95738695784843
 did charlotte dine with you         126.59985258292326
 no she would go home         34.3286764218236
 i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies         14.678844264699855
 for my part mr         95.5725409316
 bingley i always keep servants that can do their own work my daughters are brought up differently         8.359113138292056
 but every body is to judge for themselves and the lucases are very good sort of girls i assure you         6.711189143998747
 it is a pity they are not handsome         10.464950249950427
 not that i think charlotte so very plainbut then she is our particular friend         7.409933968136602
 she seems a very pleasant young woman said bingley         15.180376486102276
 lady lucas herself has often said so and envied me janes beauty         14.879148669813862
 i do not like to boast of my own child but to be sure janeone does not often see any body better looking         5.4824146925346655
 it is what every body says         24.165641098018206
 i do not trust my own partiality         19.479613904784628
 when she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my brother gardiners in town so much in love with her that my sisterinlaw was sure he would make her an offer before we came away         3.9686036953660535
 perhaps he thought her too young         42.15349210720561
 however he wrote some verses on her and very pretty they were         14.096510950805783
 and so ended his affection said elizabeth impatiently         21.99784776453952
 there has been many a one i fancy overcome in the same way         11.054932746713199
 i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love         10.823705512799142
 i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love said darcy         8.810721872887695
 of a fine stout healthy love it may         16.50951922959993
 every thing nourishes what is strong already         76.3379789420847
 but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away         5.566048079444447
 darcy only smiled and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again         7.950226931104596
 she longed to speak but could think of nothing to say and after a short silence mrs         6.158960876523158
 bennet began repeating her thanks to mr         49.00139559078983
 bingley for his kindness to jane with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy         7.8686372823124655
 bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to be civil also and say what the occasion required         8.145512365845367
 she performed her part indeed without much graciousness but mrs         14.393151071639982
 bennet was satisfied and soon afterwards ordered her carriage         17.69282515789538
 upon this signal the youngest of her daughters put herself forward         21.6911874790798
 the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit and the result of it was that the youngest should tax mr         6.1448513876367965
 bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield         7.553508413451247
 lydia was a stout wellgrown girl of fifteen with a fine complexion and goodhumoured countenance a favourite with her mother whose affection had brought her into public at an early age         5.448894865606826
 she had high animal spirits and a sort of natural selfconsequence which the attentions of the officers to whom her uncles good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her had increased into assurance         5.682798079649913
 she was very equal therefore to address mr         13.45842052324826
 bingley on the subject of the ball and abruptly reminded him of his promise adding that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it         3.3278612459885313
 his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mothers ear         9.62454176683591
 i am perfectly ready i assure you to keep my engagement and when your sister is recovered you shall if you please name the very day of the ball         5.665451363700366
 but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill         5.594355117040674
 lydia declared herself satisfied         225.8978460375603
 i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not         9.126707182094908
 bennet and her daughters then departed and elizabeth returned instantly to jane leaving her own and her relations behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr         4.883020104805076
 darcy the latter of whom however could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her in spite of all miss bingleys witticisms on fine eyes         4.654445156402798
 chapter x         14675.902278985472
 the day passed much as the day before had done         15.233977598335137
 the loo table however did not appear         43.58212108691183
 darcy was writing and miss bingley seated near him was watching the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister         6.507893661861628
 hurst and mr         219.48507591851273
 bingley were at piquet and mrs         26.419884795857964
 hurst was observing their game         111.66774144615835
 elizabeth took up some needlework and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion         8.195717989486571
 the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his handwriting or on the evenness of his lines or on the length of his letter with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received formed a curious dialogue and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each         5.876446786765482
 how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter         15.689596813916074
 he made no answer         53.352781645030674
 you write uncommonly fast         237.2097219983478
 you are mistaken         481.2170970244293
 i write rather slowly         149.55996704622783
 how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of the year         7.387822605950744
 letters of business too         171.57735644921192
 how odious i should think them         71.30812684843103
 it is fortunate then that they fall to my lot instead of to yours         10.417360048360894
 i have already told her so once by your desire         15.715178047367052
 let me mend it for you         78.97838591618797
 i mend pens remarkably well         249.9886400331509
 thank youbut i always mend my own         51.29747712241147
 how can you contrive to write so even         19.307216682172612
 he was silent         265.86255380683934
 tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantleys         4.821597728775803
 will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again         8.396140715928034
at present i have not room to do them justice         13.38839275821153
 it is of no consequence         22.749733847271234
 i shall see her in january         29.22068467934117
 but do you always write such charming long letters to her mr         10.086753095002507
 they are generally long but whether always charming it is not for me to determine         10.840637159421187
 it is a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter with ease cannot write ill         6.263725361901276
 that will not do for a compliment to darcy caroline cried her brotherbecause he does not write with ease         6.834946527219035
 he studies too much for words of four syllables         24.573806195209233
do not you darcy         69.92827348065862
 cried miss bingley charles writes in the most careless way imaginable         16.241254968546226
 he leaves out half his words and blots the rest         19.953672854591442
 my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express themby which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents         7.891452831359582
 your humility mr         590.6418355116352
 bingley said elizabeth must disarm reproof         32.4879368615068
 nothing is more deceitful said darcy than the appearance of humility         12.55704913039135
 and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty         6.561080151984199
 the indirect boastfor you are really proud of your defects in writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think at least highly interesting         7.050000153350318
 the power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance         5.468511609365909
 when you told mrs         112.49274103626826
 bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of panegyric of compliment to yourselfand yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else         4.769290918981134
 nay cried bingley this is too much to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning         9.107909465812922
 and yet upon my honour i believed what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at this moment         6.416683005115435
 at least therefore i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies         9.01712609062679
 your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man i know and if as you were mounting your horse a friend were to say bingley you had better stay till next week you would probably do it you would probably not goand at another word might stay a month         5.05041523198318
 you have only proved by this cried elizabeth that mr         12.807237852714987
 bingley did not do justice to his own disposition         13.492785130065004
 i am exceedingly gratified said bingley by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper         7.8739133113750395
 but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend for he would certainly think the better of me if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as i could         4.4904792852350885
 would mr         212.40530701516283
 darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it         8.707748968796727
 you expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine but which i have never acknowledged         7.234044155043098
 allowing the case however to stand according to your representation you must remember miss bennet that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety         5.2373732613020065
 to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either         13.436909996910245
 you appear to me mr         34.13889429553909
 darcy to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection         12.199221295051547
 a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it         6.304753057995672
 i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr         8.852117974115057
 we may as well wait perhaps till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon         6.837609285320341
 but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to be argued into it         4.939352041773658
 will it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties         4.766335994731036
 by all means cried bingley let us hear all the particulars not forgetting their comparative height and size for that will have more weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of         5.565398159857654
 i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much deference         5.659294229348038
 darcy smiled but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended and therefore checked her laugh         7.874052603706208
 miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense         9.94201451714913
 i see your design bingley said his friend         18.387884167336036
you dislike an argument and want to silence this         16.916605107051595
 perhaps i do         311.6734820835807
 arguments are too much like disputes         76.59217071114655
 what you ask said elizabeth is no sacrifice on my side and mr         11.377355930014637
 darcy had much better finish his letter         22.33949403872724
 when that business was over he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music         7.291960846357019
 miss bingley moved with alacrity to the pianoforte and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived she seated herself         6.697347581233899
 hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument how frequently mr         6.694557438832096
 darcys eyes were fixed on her         33.51083947855692
 she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange         5.492042389015553
 she could only imagine however at last that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible according to his ideas of right than in any other person present         5.17115882126252
 the supposition did not pain her         43.20880485671759
 she liked him too little to care for his approbation         13.66757026550936
 after playing some italian songs miss bingley varied the charm by a lively scotch air and soon afterwards mr         9.360669828532904
 darcy drawing near elizabeth said to her do not you feel a great inclination miss bennet to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel         7.451231134609645
 she smiled but made no answer         33.419763308987434
 he repeated the question with some surprise at her silence         12.22684954844225
 said she i heard you before but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply         6.256029006235024
 you wanted me i know to say yes that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt         5.563915152159588
 i have therefore made up my mind to tell you that i do not want to dance a reel at alland now despise me if you dare         5.738300510903215
 indeed i do not dare         53.356276385012116
 he really believed that were it not for the inferiority of her connections he should be in some danger         7.6345696132867
 miss bingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth         5.698057314892095
 she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest by talking of their supposed marriage and planning his happiness in such an alliance         7.405332225792814
 i hope said she as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day you will give your motherinlaw a few hints when this desirable event takes place as to the advantage of holding her tongue and if you can compass it do cure the younger girls of running after the officers         4.453564805361251
 have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity         10.284092164867278
 yes         1943.5370370370372
do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley         7.674786318136735
 put them next to your great uncle the judge         23.494320606817215
 they are in the same profession you know only in different lines         9.487225257502585
 as for your elizabeths picture you must not attempt to have it taken for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes         6.0211504236109175
 it would not be easy indeed to catch their expression but their colour and shape and the eyelashes so remarkably fine might be copied         5.342125680130853
 at that moment they were met from another walk by mrs         12.598554219091952
 hurst and elizabeth herself         91.39570570425165
 you used us abominably ill answered mrs         32.668183601639704
 hurst in running away without telling us that you were coming out         15.35612570414634
 then taking the disengaged arm of mr         25.46147738320219
 darcy she left elizabeth to walk by herself         19.462320718630817
 the path just admitted three         80.72669181926776
 darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said this walk is not wide enough for our party         9.170415497606916
 we had better go into the avenue         27.335509382726865
 but elizabeth who had not the least inclination to remain with them laughingly answered no no stay where you are         6.5587104768032845
you are charmingly groupd and appear to uncommon advantage         24.47528062245292
 the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth         22.58024774283096
 good bye         3838.148357502032
 jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening         6.339446424920685
 when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her sister and seeing her well guarded from cold attended her into the drawingroom where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared         4.710832145833906
 their powers of conversation were considerable         36.87364198722584
 they could describe an entertainment with accuracy relate an anecdote with humour and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit         9.06863551921403
 but when the gentlemen entered jane was no longer the first object         8.635963642370413
 miss bingleys eyes were instantly turned towards darcy and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps         7.916785162548516
 he addressed himself directly to miss bennet with a polite congratulation mr         13.182215621289576
 hurst also made her a slight bow and said he was very glad but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingleys salutation         8.210012816457802
 the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire lest she should suffer from the change of room and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fireplace that she might be farther from the door         4.33874746713108
 he then sat down by her and talked scarcely to any one else         10.300490619524856
 elizabeth at work in the opposite corner saw it all with great delight         10.087495102399414
 when tea was over mr         50.54444463866415
 hurst reminded his sisterinlaw of the cardtablebut in vain         24.45512240520572
 hurst soon found even his open petition rejected         32.7725353477118
 she assured him that no one intended to play and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her         5.856695312632245
 hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep         6.432425753670782
 darcy took up a book miss bingley did the same and mrs         13.459471104426614
 hurst principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings joined now and then in her brothers conversation with miss bennet         11.115474428486168
 miss bingleys attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr         15.385746021528794
 darcys progress through his book as in reading her own and she was perpetually either making some inquiry or looking at his page         9.13707576979535
 at length quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his she gave a great yawn and said how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way         5.39262494351077
 i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading         17.84545676157207
 how much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book         15.518987435108574
when i have a house of my own i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library         6.465087512027566
 no one made any reply         57.54994548329436
i would advise you before you determine on it to consult the wishes of the present party i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure         5.156669377740384
 if you mean darcy cried her brother he may go to bed if he chuses before it beginsbut as for the ball it is quite a settled thing and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards         5.136406898593772
 i should like balls infinitely better she replied if they were carried on in a different manner but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting         5.652540140014666
 it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day         9.532675908644825
 much more rational my dear caroline i dare say but it would not be near so much like a ball         6.534869438999372
 miss bingley made no answer and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room         7.992956635465851
 her figure was elegant and she walked wellbut darcy at whom it was all aimed was still inflexibly studious         7.579862093102457
 in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more and turning to elizabeth said miss eliza bennet let me persuade you to follow my example and take a turn about the room         6.047689566729467
i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude         10.166504318348885
 elizabeth was surprised but agreed to it immediately         16.37526753580788
 miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility mr         15.142695187302229
 darcy looked up         544.7075499754617
 he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be and unconsciously closed his book         5.633007932789087
 what could he mean         65.94699403897637
 not at all was her answer but depend upon it he means to be severe on us and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it         4.747115300187309
 miss bingley however was incapable of disappointing mr         25.43001113125072
 darcy in any thing and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives         7.9965990117240695
 you either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each others confidence and have secret affairs to discuss or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walkingif the first i should be completely in your wayand if the second i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire         4.8588795580481206
 shocking         20990.2
 cried miss bingley         742.8802320762197
 i never heard any thing so abominable         22.621115228548323
 nothing so easy if you have but the inclination said elizabeth         15.414852218260773
 we can all plague and punish one another         20.66905879446298
 teaze himlaugh at him         998.9480801563748
intimate as you are you must know how it is to be done         8.898572533985122
 i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that         8.835562360813313
 teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind         39.71935517706837
 no noi feel he may defy us there         45.41026286212998
 and as to laughter we will not expose ourselves if you please by attempting to laugh without a subject         5.60619224032228
 darcy may hug himself         534.0001195153249
 darcy is not to be laughed at         13.164940113796511
 that is an uncommon advantage and uncommon i hope it will continue for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance         4.407224735526961
 i dearly love a laugh         112.14762099318662
 miss bingley said he has given me credit for more than can be         11.62482553064582
 the wisest and the best of men nay the wisest and best of their actions may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke         5.430381346235657
 i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good         12.216872577532982
 follies and nonsense whims and inconsistencies do divert me i own and i laugh at them whenever i can         10.098731921081733
but these i suppose are precisely what you are without         12.763260374621735
 perhaps that is not possible for any one         17.708012836876346
 such as vanity and pride         63.12361172561841
 yes vanity is a weakness indeed         57.373684100170344
 but pridewhere there is a real superiority of mind pride will be always under good regulation         11.73493026426247
 elizabeth turned away to hide a smile         31.38137754704637
 darcy is over i presume said miss bingleyand pray what is the result         9.568374657715525
 i am perfectly convinced by it that mr         25.83285123818979
 darcy has no defect         103.39600625738557
 he owns it himself without disguise         56.09667994548509
 nosaid darcy i have made no such pretension         27.397593334874948
 i have faults enough but they are not i hope of understanding         11.04820266415049
 my temper i dare not vouch for         24.637223371093942
it is i believe too little yieldingcertainly too little for the convenience of the world         5.394970319598377
 i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought nor their offences against myself         8.796697327055627
 my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them         10.64281182340102
 my temper would perhaps be called resentful         29.337345038048948
my good opinion once lost is lost for ever         15.654337988677444
 that is a failing indeed         25.969629364007503
cried elizabeth         630.5540230023463
i really cannot laugh at it         38.38954179311722
 you are safe from me         79.4474028226113
 there is i believe in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil a natural defect which not even the best education can overcome         6.164467626944663
 and your defect is a propensity to hate every body         15.839259105668493
 and yours he replied with a smile is wilfully to misunderstand them         9.111031571352939
 do let us have a little musiccried miss bingley tired of a conversation in which she had no share         8.546963905170927
louisa you will not mind my waking mr         22.079326254017797
 hurst         3498.366666666667
 her sister made not the smallest objection and the pianoforte was opened and darcy after a few moments recollection was not sorry for it         5.402955993408411
 he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention         9.470845265436582
 chapter xii         14675.902278985472
 in consequence of an agreement between the sisters elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day         4.202293585387907
 but mrs         253.28235779829197
 bennet who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday which would exactly finish janes week could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before         5.84364805403873
 her answer therefore was not propitious at least not to elizabeths wishes for she was impatient to get home         8.063460644619493
 bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday and in her postscript it was added that if mr         7.143428605410508
 bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer she could spare them very well         7.373284534993767
against staying longer however elizabeth was positively resolvednor did she much expect it would be asked and fearful on the contrary as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long she urged jane to borrow mr         6.7676653165554965
 bingleys carriage immediately and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned and the request made         6.964291383495793
 the communication excited many professions of concern and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane and till the morrow their going was deferred         6.097284677162732
 miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other         5.919522586843356
 the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for herthat she was not enough recovered but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right         4.156471632598733
 to mr         75.9321085297702
 darcy it was welcome intelligenceelizabeth had been at netherfield long enough         9.815686394644333
 he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity sensible that if such an idea had been suggested his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it         5.21892763725493
 steady to his purpose he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour he adhered most conscientiously to his book and would not even look at her         4.7175819934887535
 on sunday after morning service the separation so agreeable to almost all took place         12.084059303574067
 they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother         11.920925417021664
 bennet wondered at their coming and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble and was sure jane would have caught cold again         6.809001197896747
but their father though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure was really glad to see them he had felt their importance in the family circle         5.640608332391469
 the evening conversation when they were all assembled had lost much of its animation and almost all its sense by the absence of jane and elizabeth         5.443139741133524
 they found mary as usual deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature and had some new extracts to admire and some new observations of threadbare morality to listen to         6.242759994200821
 catherine and lydia had information for them of a different sort         10.70737919841147
 much had been done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle a private had been flogged and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married         4.710622540794736
 bennet to his wife as they were at breakfast the next morning that you have ordered a good dinner today because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party         4.974244450561788
 who do you mean my dear         30.262519693566066
 i know of nobody that is coming i am sure unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in and i hope my dinners are good enough for her         5.2978019375261365
 i do not believe she often sees such at home         9.038577814688681
 the person of whom i speak is a gentleman and a stranger         6.909842789538984
 bennets eyes sparkled         8616.940030197835
a gentleman and a stranger         19.679313612132436
 it is mr         123.16125908742279
 bingley i am sure         96.12683568876022
 why janeyou never dropt a word of this you sly thing         25.872664307217818
 well i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr         6.841964163345425
 there is not a bit of fish to be got today         8.32947839857732
 lydia my love ring the bell         42.41958226619755
 i must speak to hill this moment         25.48206800234381
 bingley said her husband it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life         5.525755661305108
 this roused a general astonishment and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once         5.395324578880122
 after amusing himself some time with their curiosity he thus explained         19.965866382216564
 about a month ago i received this letter and about a fortnight ago i answered it for i thought it a case of some delicacy and requiring early attention         6.7054378048019325
 it is from my cousin mr         22.36953275646685
 collins who when i am dead may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases         5.984096170961429
 my dear cried his wife i cannot bear to hear that mentioned         10.727599615926424
 i do think it is the hardest thing in the world that your estate should be entailed away from your own children and i am sure if i had been you i should have tried long ago to do something or other about it         4.572330634166764
 bennet was beyond the reach of reason and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about         5.223079778762329
 it certainly is a most iniquitous affair said mr         15.080743156830613
 bennet and nothing can clear mr         25.834540224024167
 collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn         17.140925218441584
 no that i am sure i shall not and i think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all and very hypocritical         3.8604268843355287
 i hate such false friends         74.35481790548248
 why could not he keep on quarrelling with you as his father did before him         8.6192510313246
 why indeed he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head as you will hear         8.478902439502248
 hunsford near westerham kent th october         184.70173357834543
 dear sir the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness and since i have had the misfortune to lose him i have frequently wished to heal the breach but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance         4.274435744605132
there mrs         415.0501843842381
my mind however is now made up on the subject for having received ordination at easter i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh widow of sir lewis de bourgh whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england         3.9525345042183635
 as a clergyman moreover i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures of goodwill are highly commendable and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch         4.345141971913165
 if you should have no objection to receive me into your house i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family monday november th by four oclock and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday senight following which i can do without any inconvenience as lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day         4.195785218792845
 at four oclock therefore we may expect this peacemaking gentleman said mr         17.30408485250461
 bennet as he folded up the letter         17.337225425549054
 he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man upon my word and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again         4.991321251320711
 there is some sense in what he says about the girls however and if he is disposed to make them any amends i shall not be the person to discourage him         5.260299935328859
 though it is difficult said jane to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due the wish is certainly to his credit         5.610601860424242
 he must be an oddity i think said she         13.440070515463677
 i cannot make him out         59.51880819064455
and what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail         5.656931545657618
we cannot suppose he would help it if he could         20.57251726916369
can he be a sensible man sir         20.548018204136337
 i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse         13.101446514014167
 i am impatient to see him         63.1634828108091
 the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new yet i think it is well expressed         6.873719495672284
 to catherine and lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting         7.828969591449198
 it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour         5.188420347578063
 as for their mother mr         29.063385742448084
 collinss letter had done away much of her illwill and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters         6.343364441824054
 collins was punctual to his time and was received with great politeness by the whole family         10.011419838504661
 bennet indeed said little but the ladies were ready enough to talk and mr         9.954867751010418
 collins seemed neither in need of encouragement nor inclined to be silent himself         13.881842464161732
 he was a tall heavy looking young man of five and twenty         8.01233201304428
 his air was grave and stately and his manners were very formal         10.667131522848354
 he had not been long seated before he complimented mrs         6.998320503127472
 bennet on having so fine a family of daughters said he had heard much of their beauty but that in this instance fame had fallen short of the truth and added that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage         4.66760961165338
 this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers but mrs         9.808721333189705
 bennet who quarrelled with no compliments answered most readily you are very kind sir i am sure and i wish with all my heart it may prove so for else they will be destitute enough         5.534305892694846
 you allude perhaps to the entail of this estate         30.559651680063997
 ah         20990.2
 sir i do indeed         112.69884953854002
 it is a grievous affair to my poor girls you must confess         8.525024045763995
 not that i mean to find fault with you for such things i know are all chance in this world         6.031421551129536
 there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed         8.958853068385508
 i am very sensible madam of the hardship to my fair cousinsand could say much on the subject but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate         5.744292703476545
 but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them         7.877342820577442
 they were not the only objects of mr         15.193727580481312
 collinss admiration         3071.1925565433753
 bennets heart but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property         9.570423334017285
 the dinner too in its turn was highly admired and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of its cookery was owing         6.2226336814276255
 but here he was set right by mrs         16.92877590763711
 he begged pardon for having displeased her         50.222174407042594
 in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour         5.393404857487543
 chapter xiv         14675.902278985472
 during dinner mr         1035.3966378548262
 bennet scarcely spoke at all but when the servants were withdrawn he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness         5.420827539595164
 lady catherine de bourghs attention to his wishes and consideration for his comfort appeared very remarkable         12.463046914278223
 bennet could not have chosen better         29.76058233103308
 collins was eloquent in her praise         64.9782516161447
 the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of ranksuch affability and condescension as he had himself experienced from lady catherine         5.481361304079767
 she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings and had sent for him only the saturday before to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening         5.299528300950804
 lady catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew but he had never seen any thing but affability in her         7.3002841057351855
 she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two to visit his relations         4.4680151822325795
 she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could provided he chose with discretion and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herselfsome shelves in the closets up stairs         4.370485755399895
 that is all very proper and civil i am sure said mrs         7.355147605382992
 bennet and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman         3.7070482389386927
 it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her         6.796226959071344
 the garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from rosings park her ladyships residence         7.145503988139992
 i think you said she was a widow sir         11.467733968621562
 has she any family         72.6636642542429
 she has one only daughter the heiress of rosings and of very extensive property         8.900899574865168
 ah         20990.2
 bennet shaking her head then she is better off than many girls         14.36456147585169
 and what sort of young lady is she         15.60859221827448
 she is a most charming young lady indeed         12.564513000110766
 lady catherine herself says that in point of true beauty miss de bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth         5.971118007445586
 she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of as i am informed by the lady who superintended her education and who still resides with them         5.384396248084805
 but she is perfectly amiable and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies         6.414444811975432
 has she been presented         81.61585654401412
 i do not remember her name among the ladies at court         10.694866266689415
 her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town and by that means as i told lady catherine myself one day has deprived the british court of its brightest ornament         6.330661835838367
 her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies         6.566966684857662
 i have more than once observed to lady catherine that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess and that the most elevated rank instead of giving her consequence would be adorned by her         5.07854656252787
these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay         6.092472649599669
 you judge very properly said mr         42.36177846979957
 bennet and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy         6.795310039825542
 may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are the result of previous study         7.697678065744621
 they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible         6.002198385222637
 bennets expectations were fully answered         135.71793152250754
 his cousin was as absurd as he had hoped and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth requiring no partner in his pleasure         4.677117364188479
 by teatime however the dose had been enough and mr         24.75530464370546
 bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawingroom again and when tea was over glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies         5.801257064982947
 collins readily assented and a book was produced but on beholding it for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library he started back and begging pardon protested that he never read novels         6.918011746096179
kitty stared at him and lydia exclaimed         43.64906763405572
other books were produced and after some deliberation he chose fordyces sermons         14.108660843424648
 lydia gaped as he opened the volume and before he had with very monotonous solemnity read three pages she interrupted him with do you know mama that my uncle philips talks of turning away richard and if he does colonel forster will hire him         5.636320026289349
 my aunt told me so herself on saturday         27.971849621943612
 i shall walk to meryton tomorrow to hear more about it and to ask when mr         9.337957245603805
 denny comes back from town         236.07422880461726
 lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue but mr         12.841900221158394
 collins much offended laid aside his book and said i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp though written solely for their benefit         6.397170418075002
 it amazes me i confessfor certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction         11.182663463461841
 but i will no longer importune my young cousin         13.250068386541406
 then turning to mr         111.73950797065474
 bennet he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon         20.396688793179994
 bennet accepted the challenge observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements         7.613839887105405
 bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydias interruption and promised that it should not occur again if he would resume his book but mr         5.1295326212355015
 collins after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will and should never resent her behaviour as any affront seated himself at another table with mr         7.252176436994717
 bennet and prepared for backgammon         60.705386940088225
 collins was not a sensible man and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father and though he belonged to one of the universities he had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful acquaintance         4.286146798251901
 the subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner but it was now a good deal counteracted by the selfconceit of a weak head living in retirement and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity         5.270092123668511
 a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant and the respect which he felt for her high rank and his veneration for her as his patroness mingling with a very good opinion of himself of his authority as a clergyman and his rights as a rector made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness selfimportance and humility         4.264415556604192
 having now a good house and very sufficient income he intended to marry and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had a wife in view as he meant to chuse one of the daughters if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report         4.897248517756372
 this was his plan of amendsof atonementfor inheriting their fathers estate and he thought it an excellent one full of eligibility and suitableness and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part         5.218689642137683
 his plan did not vary on seeing them         19.857699931346453
 the next morning however made an alteration for in a quarter of an hours têteàtête with mrs         6.947667929846799
 bennet before breakfast a conversation beginning with his parsonagehouse and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes that a mistress for it might be found at longbourn produced from her amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement a caution against the very jane he had fixed on         5.302653061007268
 collins had only to change from jane to elizabethand it was soon donedone while mrs         9.109074620821415
 bennet was stirring the fire         137.95955669918547
 bennet treasured up the hint and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces         5.771146632601958
 lydias intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten every sister except mary agreed to go with her and mr         8.143442629545353
 bennet who was most anxious to get rid of him and have his library to himself for thither mr         5.563411966764873
 collins had followed him after breakfast and there he would continue nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection but really talking to mr         6.300338772974297
 bennet with little cessation of his house and garden at hunsford         11.816194458923272
 such doings discomposed mr         1299.578367253313
 bennet exceedingly         1025.4499233408696
 in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity and though prepared as he told elizabeth to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house he was used to be free from them there his civility therefore was most prompt in inviting mr         4.949557583745764
 collins to join his daughters in their walk and mr         16.039370679435617
 collins being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader was extremely well pleased to close his large book and go         6.466276727970186
 in pompous nothings on his side and civil assents on that of his cousins their time passed till they entered meryton         10.911687062361635
 the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him         6.69698435974763
 their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed or a really new muslin in a shop window could recal them         5.026778594160953
 but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man whom they had never seen before of most gentlemanlike appearance walking with an officer on the other side of the way         4.28247621668974
 the officer was the very mr         28.235798523172026
 denny concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire and he bowed as they passed         14.252788972003346
 all were struck with the strangers air all wondered who he could be and kitty and lydia determined if possible to find out led the way across the street under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot         4.565392852851489
 denny addressed them directly and entreated permission to introduce his friend mr         17.005933982706352
 wickham who had returned with him the day before from town and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps         6.517003751920181
 this was exactly as it should be for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming         7.832253935317692
 his appearance was greatly in his favour he had all the best part of beauty a fine countenance a good figure and very pleasing address         5.904361365091486
 on distinguishing the ladies of the group the two gentlemen came directly towards them and began the usual civilities         8.036512716859537
 bingley was the principal spokesman and miss bennet the principal object         9.09293980264116
 darcy corroborated it with a bow and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting         4.752375441793857
 both changed colour one looked white the other red         36.96022631952127
 wickham after a few moments touched his hata salutation which mr         10.355511462104724
 darcy just deigned to return         163.10361887815225
 what could be the meaning of it         11.928217214256467
it was impossible to imagine it was impossible not to long to know         6.810665087795931
 in another minute mr         242.85038206083775
 bingley but without seeming to have noticed what passed took leave and rode on with his friend         7.276386627220731
 wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of mr         11.806006879814468
 philipss house and then made their bows in spite of miss lydias pressing entreaties that they would come in and even in spite of mrs         7.151481274461819
 philips throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the invitation         26.89456502180004
 philips was always glad to see her nieces and the two eldest from their recent absence were particularly welcome and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home which as their own carriage had not fetched them she should have known nothing about if she had not happened to see mr         4.925736705904019
 collins by janes introduction of him         43.95703677738146
 she received him with her very best politeness which he returned with as much more apologising for his intrusion without any previous acquaintance with her which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice         4.254272429727196
 denny had brought him from london and that he was to have a lieutenants commission in the shire         8.915853578238211
 she had been watching him the last hour she said as he walked up and down the street and had mr         5.406960273100129
 some of them were to dine with the philipses the next day and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr         4.6003662248787105
 wickham and give him an invitation also if the family from longbourn would come in the evening         7.949794326790691
 this was agreed to and mrs         39.06935107127279
 philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets and a little bit of hot supper afterwards         7.697956755317673
 as they walked home elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen but though jane would have defended either or both had they appeared to be wrong she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister         4.995498029572406
 collins on his return highly gratified mrs         19.491044823106787
 bennet by admiring mrs         372.7954262928296
 philipss manners and politeness         211.95116426886364
 he protested that except lady catherine and her daughter he had never seen a more elegant woman for she had not only received him with the utmost civility but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening although utterly unknown to her before         4.077134411464997
 something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life         5.200499451290465
 as no objection was made to the young peoples engagement with their aunt and all mr         9.655237704843513
 collinss scruples of leaving mr         104.5247577233659
 bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton and the girls had the pleasure of hearing as they entered the drawingroom that mr         4.153515328412136
 wickham had accepted their uncles invitation and was then in the house         13.740096237088041
 when this information was given and they had all taken their seats mr         12.261671735620602
 collins was at leisure to look around him and admire and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification but when mrs         4.544120058826253
 philips understood from him what rosings was and who was its proprietor when she had listened to the description of only one of lady catherines drawingrooms and found that the chimneypiece alone had cost eight hundred pounds she felt all the force of the compliment and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeepers room         4.965405325624051
 in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode and the improvements it was receiving he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them and he found in mrs         4.786763035763863
 philips a very attentive listener whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could         5.4674794276736245
 to the girls who could not listen to their cousin and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantlepiece the interval of waiting appeared very long         4.619607314625747
 it was over at last however         26.00288021578175
 the gentlemen did approach and when mr         24.376015795789673
 the officers of the shire were in general a very creditable gentlemanlike set and the best of them were of the present party but mr         5.1040834244721465
 wickham was as far beyond them all in person countenance air and walk as they were superior to the broadfaced stuffy uncle philips breathing port wine who followed them into the room         5.440005960883537
 wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation though it was only on its being a wet night and on the probability of a rainy season made her feel that the commonest dullest most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker         4.102495198902948
 with such rivals for the notice of the fair as mr         19.786921916511023
 wickham and the officers mr         22.920122018522754
 collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance to the young ladies he certainly was nothing but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mrs         6.86834820919608
 philips and was by her watchfulness most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin         9.212584001183096
 wickham did not play at whist and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia         6.659303739719577
 at first there seemed danger of lydias engrossing him entirely for she was a most determined talker but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets she soon grew too much interested in the game too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for any one in particular         4.839977928585658
 allowing for the common demands of the game mr         16.361659273417366
 she dared not even mention that gentleman         28.387175527413117
 wickham began the subject himself         48.57863881366912
 he inquired how far netherfield was from meryton and after receiving her answer asked in an hesitating manner how long mr         9.088864232413416
 darcy had been staying there         45.7622559089916
 about a month said elizabeth and then unwilling to let the subject drop added he is a man of very large property in derbyshire i understand         7.138090399229093
 yes replied wickhamhis estate there is a noble one         42.45729405866577
 a clear ten thousand per annum         58.828239185097274
 you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myselffor i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy         5.004177810153314
 you may well be surprised miss bennet at such an assertion after seeing as you probably might the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday         6.509738151980167
are you much acquainted with mr         27.782478191566977
 as much as i ever wish to be cried elizabeth warmlyi have spent four days in the same house with him and i think him very disagreeable         5.144487507699181
 i have no right to give my opinion said wickham as to his being agreeable or otherwise         6.2866627636503685
 i am not qualified to form one         22.59516735097934
 i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge         8.789394543616018
 it is impossible for me to be impartial         9.463562769736795
 but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonishand perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else         6.399660629783478
here you are in your own family         25.648576340152697
 upon my word i say no more here than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood except netherfield         8.11074136627718
 he is not at all liked in hertfordshire         14.036318266849072
 every body is disgusted with his pride         34.543589472295494
 the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence or frightened by his high and imposing manners and sees him only as he chuses to be seen         5.764760487980311
 i should take him even on my slight acquaintance to be an illtempered man         10.074770749948609
 wickham only shook his head         120.55298193199334
 i do not at all know but i heard nothing of his going away when i was at netherfield         5.9124589097452995
 i hope your plans in favour of the shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood         7.382779139210907
 if he wishes to avoid seeing me he must go         16.345854816155363
 we are not on friendly terms and it always gives me pain to meet him but i have no reason for avoiding him but what i might proclaim to all the world a sense of very great ill usage and most painful regrets at his being what he is         4.531741931759066
 darcy was one of the best men that ever breathed and the truest friend i ever had and i can never be in company with this mr         5.854881725405499
 darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections         11.909753915201994
 his behaviour to myself has been scandalous but i verily believe i could forgive him any thing and every thing rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father         5.339716683955542
 elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase and listened with all her heart but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry         6.404032785762714
 wickham began to speak on more general topics meryton the neighbourhood the society appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen and speaking of the latter especially with gentle but very intelligible gallantry         5.028522384279113
 it was the prospect of constant society and good society he added which was my chief inducement to enter the shire         5.612380990454853
 i knew it to be a most respectable agreeable corps and my friend denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them         4.6786665851664235
 i have been a disappointed man and my spirits will not bear solitude         8.437806853557712
 i must have employment and society         24.251260739629746
 the church ought to have been my professioni was brought up for the church and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now         5.283174572798467
 indeed         1295.6913580246912
 yesthe late mr         2542.1182560703564
 darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift         15.443329752648756
 he was my godfather and excessively attached to me         11.162371215322814
 i cannot do justice to his kindness         19.975720166874467
 he meant to provide for me amply and thought he had done it but when the living fell it was given elsewhere         6.09074589501432
 good heavens         4246.936179944213
 cried elizabeth but how could that be         25.782493359693383
why did not you seek legal redress         21.91686867076953
 there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law         7.37017042425705
 a man of honour could not have doubted the intention but mr         8.99795470653606
 darcy chose to doubt itor to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance imprudence in short any thing or nothing         5.706299764609365
 i have a warm unguarded temper and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him and to him too freely         5.618919129570028
 i can recal nothing worse         113.96773025654824
 but the fact is that we are very different sort of men and that he hates me         6.780734142817124
 this is quite shocking         108.37006439190053
he deserves to be publicly disgraced         36.3862429868236
 but what said she after a pause can have been his motive         10.267232574913304
what can have induced him to behave so cruelly         16.07080955024629
 a thorough determined dislike of mea dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy         10.814064678142227
 had the late mr         90.321417488929
 darcy liked me less his son might have borne with me better but his fathers uncommon attachment to me irritated him i believe very early in life         6.663278192413761
 i had not thought mr         20.187698835408646
 darcy so bad as thisthough i have never liked him i had not thought so very ill of himi had supposed him to be despising his fellowcreatures in general but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge such injustice such inhumanity as this         5.154400840532004
 after a few minutes reflection however she continued i do remember his boasting one day at netherfield of the implacability of his resentments of his having an unforgiving temper         5.82328398882519
 his disposition must be dreadful         61.41146704707995
 i will not trust myself on the subject replied wickham i can hardly be just to him         7.244355568645099
 elizabeth was again deep in thought and after a time exclaimed to treat in such a manner the godson the friend the favourite of his father         5.5142873205387
she could have added a young man too like you whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiablebut she contented herself with and one too who had probably been his own companion from childhood connected together as i think you said in the closest manner         4.777102124200307
 we were born in the same parish within the same park the greatest part of our youth was passed together inmates of the same house sharing the same amusements objects of the same parental care         5.951171988204015
 my father began life in the profession which your uncle mr         15.513519882706865
 philips appears to do so much credit tobut he gave up every thing to be of use to the late mr         7.107675489074638
 darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property         10.207527296257819
 he was most highly esteemed by mr         18.76441142541288
 darcy a most intimate confidential friend         29.007728465304567
 darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him as of affection to myself         5.055113530123976
 how strange         2048.4636250482367
 how abominable         1956.3529426779762
i wonder that the very pride of this mr         13.962395888014946
 darcy has not made him just to you         18.156370863111686
 it is wonderfulreplied wickhamfor almost all his actions may be traced to prideand pride has often been his best friend         9.386891725182156
 but we are none of us consistent and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride         7.214784685150339
 can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good         17.966951661870503
 yes         1943.5370370370372
 it has often led him to be liberal and generousto give his money freely to display hospitality to assist his tenants and relieve the poor         6.500466311868837
 family pride and filial pride for he is very proud of what his father was have done this         7.831632937700089
 not to appear to disgrace his family to degenerate from the popular qualities or lose the influence of the pemberley house is a powerful motive         6.027550096488712
 he shook his head         72.85239834204813
i wish i could call her amiable         12.903779648390277
 it gives me pain to speak ill of a darcy         13.988849253464597
 but she is too much like her brothervery very proud         10.99926445497296
as a child she was affectionate and pleasing and extremely fond of me and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement         6.7661123352157135
 but she is nothing to me now         16.894626576812254
 she is a handsome girl about fifteen or sixteen and i understand highly accomplished         7.552621454613358
 since her fathers death her home has been london where a lady lives with her and superintends her education         8.850980394577105
 after many pauses and many trials of other subjects elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first and saying i am astonished at his intimacy with mr         6.746126809695964
 how can mr         330.48931283793974
 bingley who seems good humour itself and is i really believe truly amiable be in friendship with such a man         8.568572338062914
do you know mr         94.2779852452976
 not at all         117.89230474173048
 he cannot know what mr         60.38195823081316
 darcy is         236.38890949069835
 probably notbut mr         3308.7425729496995
 darcy can please where he chuses         63.23599058564316
 he does not want abilities         45.46634656120346
 he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while         9.431804277798614
 among those who are at all his equals in consequence he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous         7.377179656609663
 his pride never deserts him but with the rich he is liberalminded just sincere rational honourable and perhaps agreeableallowing something for fortune and figure         6.838592520215048
 the whist party soon afterwards breaking up the players gathered round the other table and mr         10.646743629405025
 collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mrs         15.338315410905967
 philips         4770.5
the usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter         15.726012718919877
 it had not been very great he had lost every point but when mrs         8.05201729330219
 philips began to express her concern thereupon he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance that he considered the money as a mere trifle and begged she would not make herself uneasy         5.219874490464836
 i know very well madam said he that when persons sit down to a card table they must take their chance of these thingsand happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object         5.165574050506825
 there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters         5.771741447539192
 wickhams attention was caught and after observing mr         24.675100116878387
 collins for a few moments he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh         4.098141490608805
 lady catherine de bourgh she replied has very lately given him a living         12.310465532576842
 i hardly know how mr         51.01372430966615
 collins was first introduced to her notice but he certainly has not known her long         9.262042274915215
 you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy were sisters consequently that she is aunt to the present mr         4.760839151092303
i knew nothing at all of lady catherines connections         18.08649197214488
 i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday         10.195064368519589
 her daughter miss de bourgh will have a very large fortune and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates         5.941570416994642
 this information made elizabeth smile as she thought of poor miss bingley         13.885875744421844
 vain indeed must be all her attentions vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself if he were already selfdestined to another         6.976684146544413
 collins said she speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship i suspect his gratitude misleads him and that in spite of her being his patroness she is an arrogant conceited woman         3.8514774759515764
 i believe her to be both in a great degree replied wickham i have not seen her for many years but i very well remember that i never liked her and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent         4.499208345602546
 elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr         4.336299908624126
 wickhams attentions         2757.6318451594243
 philipss supper party but his manners recommended him to every body         27.448183471950422
 whatever he said was said well and whatever he did done gracefully         12.113623100056483
 elizabeth went away with her head full of him         19.293783359649318
 she could think of nothing but of mr         7.982292140175895
 wickham and of what he had told her all the way home but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went for neither lydia nor mr         4.531266921631731
 collins were once silent         149.77328156592506
 lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won and mr         8.827630726662305
 collins in describing the civility of mr         38.89748697051777
 philips protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist enumerating all the dishes at supper and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house         4.985417989812543
 chapter xvii         14675.902278985472
 elizabeth related to jane the next day what had passed between mr         8.14819129591042
 jane listened with astonishment and concernshe knew not how to believe that mr         9.741250997864283
 bingleys regard and yet it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham         4.257893253704378
the possibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough to interest all her tender feelings and nothing therefore remained to be done but to think well of them both to defend the conduct of each and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained         4.049377796983388
 they have both said she been deceived i dare say in some way or other of which we can form no idea         7.262627264593444
 it is in short impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them without actual blame on either side         5.384761439698143
 very true indeedand now my dear jane what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business         7.7670715048711605
do clear them too or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody         10.100550013569197
 my dearest lizzy do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places mr         10.403574615487381
 darcy to be treating his fathers favourite in such a mannerone whom his father had promised to provide for         6.485796052234993
 no man of common humanity no man who had any value for his character could be capable of it         7.003286605510946
 can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him         12.470965503765006
 no         257.86486486486484
 i can much more easily believe mr         22.033601216426913
 bingleys being imposed on than that mr         58.5783236990138
 wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night names facts every thing mentioned without ceremony         10.274083787622775
if it be not so let mr         18.963731628934394
 darcy contradict it         751.9267399873942
 besides there was truth in his looks         30.132388244542522
 it is difficult indeedit is distressing         42.83374499199204
one does not know what to think         14.7113805197646
 i beg your pardonone knows exactly what to think         19.858356440585577
 but jane could think with certainty on only one pointthat mr         11.86333803464851
 bingley if he had been imposed on would have much to suffer when the affair became public         6.759502478153274
 the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking mr         5.496194803068086
 bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield which was fixed for the following tuesday         5.2700066478781915
 the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again called it an age since they had met and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation         5.907402199935725
 to the rest of the family they paid little attention avoiding mrs         5.199858396402919
 they were soon gone again rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs         6.044724949179852
 bennets civilities         4330.582518464388
 the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family         8.229341112943748
 bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from mr         6.352331303003535
 bingley himself instead of a ceremonious card         38.2488724898803
 jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends and the attentions of their brother and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr         6.066511050441397
 darcys looks and behaviour         155.2964557138244
 the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia depended less on any single event or any particular person for though they each like elizabeth meant to dance half the evening with mr         6.658252801914602
 and even mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it         9.215808896797293
 while i can have my mornings to myself said she it is enough         9.684309268213074
i think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements         10.588041147431863
 society has claims on us all and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body         8.183884582178994
 elizabeths spirits were so high on the occasion that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr         8.47223055667748
 collins she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr         7.457724841145374
 bingleys invitation and if he did whether he would think it proper to join in the evenings amusement and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop or lady catherine de bourgh by venturing to dance         4.152303867884974
 i am by no means of opinion i assure you said he that a ball of this kind given by a young man of character to respectable people can have any evil tendency and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours miss elizabeth for the two first dances especiallya preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause and not to any disrespect for her         3.277034289814542
 elizabeth felt herself completely taken in         38.65413867114294
 she had fully proposed being engaged by wickham for those very dancesand to have mr         10.28447423667688
 collins instead         1447.963302500306
 her liveliness had been never worse timed         30.747672806494503
 there was no help for it however         20.55003887223342
 wickhams happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer and mr         9.332097483269406
 collinss proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could         25.129738495336202
 she was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more         6.650331254262367
it now first struck her that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of hunsford parsonage and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings in the absence of more eligible visitors         4.818812903383222
 the idea soon reached to conviction as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her         4.707532683669714
 elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply         6.754989917562148
 if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of the younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time for from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once         4.347490276523811
 no aunt no officers no news could be sought afterthe very shoeroses for netherfield were got by proxy         8.608136361586798
 even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr         6.795468818034718
 wickham and nothing less than a dance on tuesday could have made such a friday saturday sunday and monday endurable to kitty and lydia         5.544027327605923
 chapter xviii         14675.902278985472
 till elizabeth entered the drawingroom at netherfield and looked in vain for mr         13.161836990112766
 wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her         7.389805616866929
 the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her         6.607868746457659
 she had dressed with more than usual care and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening         4.144472579405186
 but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr         7.5024084091584164
 darcys pleasure in the bingleys invitation to the officers and though this was not exactly the case the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend mr         5.825993670429787
 denny to whom lydia eagerly applied and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before and was not yet returned adding with a significant smile i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here         4.622886627130646
 this part of his intelligence though unheard by lydia was caught by elizabeth and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickhams absence than if her first surmise had been just every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make         4.462695275483332
attention forbearance patience with darcy was injury to wickham         41.25368384908043
 bingley whose blind partiality provoked her         76.4951953969848
 but elizabeth was not formed for illhumour and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening it could not dwell long on her spirits and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas whom she had not seen for a week she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin and to point him out to her particular notice         4.339838770334177
 the two first dances however brought a return of distress they were dances of mortification         8.017632218365218
 the moment of her release from him was ecstacy         11.935341793322358
 she danced next with an officer and had the refreshment of talking of wickham and of hearing that he was universally liked         7.76874887823628
 when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas and was in conversation with her when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr         7.57632595951381
 darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand that without knowing what she did she accepted him         6.805968380049485
 he walked away again immediately and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind charlotte tried to console her         6.921045993811657
 i dare say you will find him very agreeable         22.380747670916385
 heaven forbid         12160.184930968075
that would be the greatest misfortune of all         14.319039441855896
to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate         10.940746298808412
do not wish me such an evil         28.611755135175514
 when the dancing recommenced however and darcy approached to claim her hand charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence         4.73440178135787
 they stood for some time without speaking a word and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances and at first was resolved not to break it till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk she made some slight observation on the dance         3.9620210087144017
 he replied and was again silent         20.215953543711812
 after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with it is your turn to say something now mr         6.3291818021985895
i talked about the dance and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room or the number of couples         6.480398308407668
 he smiled and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said         8.382777805253555
that reply will do for the present         26.618432892471724
 do you talk by rule then while you are dancing         16.5387245063761
 sometimes         3498.366666666667
 one must speak a little you know         32.29761700840104
 it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of some conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible         4.2237879660498
 are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine         9.261482715361403
 both replied elizabeth archly for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds         8.789535699521474
we are each of an unsocial taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb         5.781336166999989
 this is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am sure said he         7.116219061930682
 how near it may be to mine i cannot pretend to say         11.58998973884314
you think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly         19.57795065262256
 i must not decide on my own performance         15.001344522554286
 he made no answer and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton         4.453840387959699
 she answered in the affirmative and unable to resist the temptation added when you met us there the other day we had just been forming a new acquaintance         5.462034689975697
 the effect was immediate         75.95074926314079
 at length darcy spoke and in a constrained manner said mr         17.158096195460228
 wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friendswhether he may be equally capable of retaining them is less certain         8.368357157049642
 he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship replied elizabeth with emphasis and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life         5.208366480165214
 darcy made no answer and seemed desirous of changing the subject         8.813362166742856
 at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room but on perceiving mr         4.419819457771863
 such very superior dancing is not often seen         26.131100425344233
 it is evident that you belong to the first circles         15.356110250494167
 what congratulations will then flow in         48.247147933676054
 i appeal to mr         149.36666200402536
 darcybut let me not interrupt you sir         60.226183835988465
you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me         6.268084420822616
 the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy but sir williams allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane who were dancing together         5.706272053580245
 recovering himself however shortly he turned to his partner and said sir williams interruption has made me forget what we were talking of         8.414481392777075
 i do not think we were speaking at all         8.315167399340702
 sir william could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves         9.83059644789877
 what think you of books         45.68457602812971
 said he smiling         630.1285492529995
 booksoh         104951.0
 no         257.86486486486484
 i am sorry you think so but if that be the case there can at least be no want of subject         8.219759714376705
we may compare our different opinions         113.05874975285792
 noi cannot talk of books in a ballroom my head is always full of something else         14.02481934223035
 the present always occupies you in such scenesdoes it         16.55605544730548
 yes always she replied without knowing what she said for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming i remember hearing you once say mr         5.656174626016804
 darcy that you hardly ever forgave that your resentment once created was unappeasable         8.564943821726745
 you are very cautious i suppose as to its being created         11.126890129669963
 i am said he with a firm voice         19.79230259348505
 and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice         17.75619211269017
 i hope not         207.65492631321968
 it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion to be secure of judging properly at first         7.8186049478479
 may i ask to what these questions tend         23.743304592359955
 merely to the illustration of your character said she endeavouring to shake off her gravity         7.627319374044893
 i am trying to make it out         34.78711487732257
 and what is your success         28.835281474154677
 she shook her head         85.72910448023063
 i do not get on at all         19.28805232731373
 i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly         12.434365067003295
 i can readily believe answered he gravely that report may vary greatly with respect to me and i could wish miss bennet that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either         4.885623204731908
 but if i do not take your likeness now i may never have another opportunity         7.205716001879928
 they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her so miss eliza i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham         4.925326015122239
your sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a thousand questions and i find that the young man forgot to tell you among his other communications that he was the son of old wickham the late mr         5.196046806842826
 darcys steward         6015.764035183928
 let me recommend you however as a friend not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions for as to mr         8.732851769650923
 darcys using him ill it is perfectly false for on the contrary he has been always remarkably kind to him though george wickham has treated mr         7.286766942208058
 darcy in a most infamous manner         19.2572993954245
 i do not know the particulars but i know very well that mr         6.022449961179268
 darcy is not in the least to blame that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way         3.6459450302919727
 his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it         5.605040056573947
 i pity you miss eliza for this discovery of your favourites guilt but really considering his descent one could not expect much better         6.979407662852538
 his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same said elizabeth angrily for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr         5.320265115334033
 darcys steward and of that i can assure you he informed me himself         11.736386422446227
 i beg your pardon replied miss bingley turning away with a sneer         11.078406735388727
 excuse my interference         1591.2655766593766
it was kindly meant         123.8755161436934
 insolent girl         7005.093938283292
 said elizabeth to herself         52.40317010659205
you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this         7.83041449568535
 i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr         9.271905962322348
 jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency a glow of such happy expression as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening         4.785411177695363
elizabeth instantly read her feelings and at that moment solicitude for wickham resentment against his enemies and every thing else gave way before the hope of janes being in the fairest way for happiness         5.8561574228151745
 i want to know said she with a countenance no less smiling than her sisters what you have learnt about mr         6.525341713254046
 bingley does not know the whole of his history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr         5.730497864467259
 darcy but he will vouch for the good conduct the probity and honour of his friend and is perfectly convinced that mr         5.596779628491913
 wickham has deserved much less attention from mr         35.037489831867916
 darcy than he has received and i am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sisters mr         5.095206899775832
 wickham is by no means a respectable young man         12.371750991460145
 i am afraid he has been very imprudent and has deserved to lose mr         8.774149085249439
 darcys regard         1869.799617670645
 bingley does not know mr         45.340296164816046
 wickham himself         643.384915085539
 no he never saw him till the other morning at meryton         11.681448181549712
 this account then is what he has received from mr         17.88328257967333
 i am perfectly satisfied         174.40986091267396
 but what does he say of the living         20.103465348330502
 he does not exactly recollect the circumstances though he has heard them from mr         9.303279593591727
 darcy more than once but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only         9.023520692551779
 i have not a doubt of mr         9.012018266478611
 bingleys defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story and has learnt the rest from that friend himself i shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as i did before         5.106060513390705
 elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of bingleys regard and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it         5.241417802623775
 on their being joined by mr         33.26428327320556
 bingley himself elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied before mr         6.861058051241421
 collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery         5.815062907064335
 i have found out said he by a singular accident that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness         6.382236503136954
 i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh and of her mother lady catherine         5.307783271875185
 how wonderfully these sort of things occur         60.517216803420965
 who would have thought of my meeting withperhapsa nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly         5.116847695980389
i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him which i am now going to do and trust he will excuse my not having done it before         4.843992520616987
 my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology         28.225032285500372
 you are not going to introduce yourself to mr         9.160591630935398
 indeed i am         373.09615551436593
 i shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier         16.920455562505584
 it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday senight         4.546446834367529
 elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme assuring him that mr         14.671111590549271
 darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side and that if it were it must belong to mr         4.139512635688269
 darcy the superior in consequence to begin the acquaintance         16.787537555849678
mr         193.63653136531366
 collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination and when she ceased speaking replied thus my dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those which regulate the clergy for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdomprovided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained         3.5921472512866357
 you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty         6.048556204501975
 pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice which on every other subject shall be my constant guide though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself         4.927113599998314
 and with a low bow he left her to attack mr         7.806372236218556
 darcy whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident         9.658766924251028
 her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it she felt as if hearing it all and saw in the motion of his lips the words apology hunsford and lady catherine de bourgh         5.043928558211348
it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man         10.819951816748885
 darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder and when at last mr         14.893161746794279
 collins allowed him time to speak replied with an air of distant civility         10.660486657712099
 collins however was not discouraged from speaking again and mr         13.437620355612657
 darcys contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow and moved another way         6.024150317285701
 collins then returned to elizabeth         90.47594747103342
 i have no reason i assure you said he to be dissatisfied with my reception         5.996968748698539
 darcy seemed much pleased with the attention         29.14366328718786
 he answered me with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of lady catherines discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily         4.820321816752416
 it was really a very handsome thought         20.43623581880815
 upon the whole i am much pleased with him         16.08579062384429
 as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr         6.090989409569716
 bingley and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made her perhaps almost as happy as jane         5.77625984376426
 she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow and she felt capable under such circumstances of endeavouring even to like bingleys two sisters         5.181804861665658
 her mothers thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way and she determined not to venture near her lest she might hear too much         7.475109101561997
it was an animating subject and mrs         16.62589684232073
 bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match         12.491242036437653
 his being such a charming young man and so rich and living but three miles from them were the first points of selfgratulation and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do         4.010970184680445
 it was moreover such a promising thing for her younger daughters as janes marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men and lastly it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked         4.16663755530547
 it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure because on such occasions it is the etiquette but no one was less likely than mrs         5.507419084680514
 bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life         9.486067921123968
 she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it         6.210015496202655
 in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mothers words or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr         4.62708739728675
 darcy who sat opposite to them         46.98916075695178
 her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical         20.545694909332358
 what is mr         176.45449043987264
 darcy to me pray that i should be afraid of him         7.958263054376887
 for heavens sake madam speak lower         92.57310253766182
what advantage can it be to you to offend mr         16.82597981761017
you will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing         12.09399971346449
 nothing that she could say however had any influence         12.876920833350928
 her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone         10.993217291190595
 elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation         16.9407620721998
 she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr         7.948688372333878
 darcy though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded for though he was not always looking at her mother she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her         5.217592187414708
 the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity         7.552172675140953
 at length however mrs         234.1386250388336
 bennet had no more to say and lady lucas who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken         4.8679796917410085
 elizabeth now began to revive         65.75871302129342
 but not long was the interval of tranquillity for when supper was over singing was talked of and she had the mortification of seeing mary after very little entreaty preparing to oblige the company         5.4926986639589
 by many significant looks and silent entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisancebut in vain mary would not understand them such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her and she began her song         5.54428898693738
 elizabeths eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close for mary on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again after the pause of half a minute began another         4.363310981607758
 marys powers were by no means fitted for such a display her voice was weak and her manner affected         10.763069499565221
elizabeth was in agonies         38.96281958085969
 she looked at her father to entreat his interference lest mary should be singing all night         8.159543717024308
 you have delighted us long enough         39.77263194137252
 let the other young ladies have time to exhibit         16.823487405555927
 mary though pretending not to hear was somewhat disconcerted and elizabeth sorry for her and sorry for her fathers speech was afraid her anxiety had done no good         8.221519131162603
 if i said mr         72.99499969828646
 collins were so fortunate as to be able to sing i should have great pleasure i am sure in obliging the company with an air for i consider music as a very innocent diversion and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman         4.196416988107857
 the rector of a parish has much to do         15.786733702472484
in the first place he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron         5.316261052626371
 he must write his own sermons and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties and the care and improvement of his dwelling which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible         5.186165842197874
 and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment         4.188050245355119
 i cannot acquit him of that duty nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family         6.48743140422292
 and with a bow to mr         13.926956958367859
 darcy he concluded his speech which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room         8.584180477709875
many smiled but no one looked more amused than mr         18.04792749324646
 bennet himself while his wife seriously commended mr         24.451605465547264
 collins for having spoken so sensibly and observed in a halfwhisper to lady lucas that he was a remarkably clever good kind of young man         5.284470091302774
 that his two sisters and mr         25.604172440750023
 darcy however should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman or the insolent smiles of the ladies were more intolerable         4.735698727055057
 the rest of the evening brought her little amusement         7.014735260065894
 she was teazed by mr         79.73576953635539
 collins who continued most perseveringly by her side and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again put it out of her power to dance with others         5.147012898378265
 in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room         6.484714934923236
 he assured her that as to dancing he was perfectly indifferent to it that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening         4.714903899240817
 there was no arguing upon such a project         16.81871566966654
 she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas who often joined them and goodnaturedly engaged mr         6.575043842719912
 collinss conversation to herself         134.61500267142915
 she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr         7.068673460180426
 wickham and rejoiced in it         68.65375430123142
 the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart and by a manoeuvre of mrs         8.663377793031163
 bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family         4.475048540769971
 hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves         5.736150895947786
 they repulsed every attempt of mrs         79.35946421635947
 bennet at conversation and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr         6.5792224774827375
 collins who was complimenting mr         44.668939468022394
 bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests         5.2281708113803464
 darcy said nothing at all         54.213817647390414
 bennet in equal silence was enjoying the scene         20.073490210911032
 bingley and jane were standing together a little detached from the rest and talked only to each other         7.21550540528899
 elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mrs         19.247794957961233
 hurst or miss bingley and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of lord how tired i am         7.112331415922272
 accompanied by a violent yawn         64.58630855233419
 when at length they arose to take leave mrs         17.706059000263192
 bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn and addressed herself particularly to mr         6.6753036029203
 bingley to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time without the ceremony of a formal invitation         5.969579750208167
 bingley was all grateful pleasure and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her after his return from london whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time         4.831001389106254
 bennet was perfectly satisfied and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements new carriages and wedding clothes she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield in the course of three or four months         4.844482622414406
 of having another daughter married to mr         25.95666995304867
 collins she thought with equal certainty and with considerable though not equal pleasure         10.82024916969704
 elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her the worth of each was eclipsed by mr         4.733251371757278
 bingley and netherfield         239.18772099555997
 chapter xix         14675.902278985472
 the next day opened a new scene at longbourn         17.677362146149793
 collins made his declaration in form         33.06574250148472
 having resolved to do it without loss of time as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment he set about it in a very orderly manner with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business         4.815090466669731
 bennet elizabeth and one of the younger girls together soon after breakfast he addressed the mother in these words may i hope madam for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning         4.143523224357369
 before elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise mrs         9.856807503859764
 bennet instantly answered oh dear         109.92865292384785
yescertainly         104951.0
i am sure lizzy will be very happyi am sure she can have no objection         9.0563009951547
come kitty i want you up stairs         28.69527486568017
 and gathering her work together she was hastening away when elizabeth called out dear maam do not go         8.808546222001539
i beg you will not go         30.083784288587456
mr         193.63653136531366
 i am going away myself         78.80087227861517
 no no nonsense lizzy         192.77010967578403
i desire you will stay where you are         12.387787194745592
and upon elizabeths seeming really with vexed and embarrassed looks about to escape she added lizzy i insist upon your staying and hearing mr         6.905631290779878
 collins         760.5144927536231
 elizabeth would not oppose such an injunctionand a moments consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible she sat down again and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion         4.539410473650093
 bennet and kitty walked off and as soon as they were gone mr         4.229293387283677
 collins began         913.2417349224681
 believe me my dear miss elizabeth that your modesty so far from doing you any disservice rather adds to your other perfections         5.583523887035966
 you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mothers permission for this address         4.529639304443474
 you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken         6.54932898090027
 almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life         6.265089126834723
 but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marryingand moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife as i certainly did         4.062277600866686
 the idea of mr         49.54480072915939
 collins with all his solemn composure being run away with by his feelings made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther and he continued my reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish         4.3734208875594245
 secondly that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness and thirdlywhich perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness         4.567961262242738
 twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked too         14.656269727214035
 on this subject and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsfordbetween our pools at quadrille while mrs         6.603909562168138
 jenkinson was arranging miss de bourghs footstool that she said mr         23.324432766313027
 collins you must marry         93.68174907150264
 a clergyman like you must marry         58.28406286599723
chuse properly chuse a gentlewoman for my sake and for your own let her be an active useful sort of person not brought up high but able to make a small income go a good way         6.7885003802069575
 this is my advice         66.69761311934566
 find such a woman as soon as you can bring her to hunsford and i will visit her         5.486127065552675
 allow me by the way to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer         4.200016927156518
 you will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite         5.5514582037119515
 thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony it remains to be told why my views were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i assure you there are many amiable young women         5.190987234633268
 but the fact is that being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father who however may live many years longer i could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes placewhich however as i have already said may not be for several years         4.208549843564865
 this has been my motive my fair cousin and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem         6.864199626289755
 and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection         6.61297256678031
 to fortune i am perfectly indifferent and shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well aware that it could not be complied with and that one thousand pounds in the per cents         4.735414467138581
 which will not be yours till after your mothers decease is all that you may ever be entitled to         7.215573816184861
 on that head therefore i shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married         6.443740875971446
 it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now         15.897059339451529
 you are too hasty sir she cried         23.55179722426705
 you forget that i have made no answer         15.272612478245271
 let me do it without farther loss of time         19.13830214920363
 accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me         22.802527919993086
 i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them         5.246892698203008
 i am not now to learn replied mr         18.11252052385002
 collins with a formal wave of the hand that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept when he first applies for their favour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time         4.7449588284068716
 i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long         7.069328291727064
 upon my word sir cried elizabeth your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration         10.94703218962105
 i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time         4.169726862786307
 i am perfectly serious in my refusal         33.940713766127054
you could not make me happy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make you so         5.445573645102856
nay were your friend lady catherine to know me i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation         6.8085678277817285
 were it certain that lady catherine would think so said mr         12.357747337099797
 collins very gravelybut i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you         14.15705811750689
 and you may be certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty economy and other amiable qualifications         4.15518633688769
 indeed mr         439.2983401644106
 collins all praise of me will be unnecessary         26.235323830931705
 you must give me leave to judge for myself and pay me the compliment of believing what i say         5.148217863460333
 i wish you very happy and very rich and by refusing your hand do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise         5.22988461309116
 in making me the offer you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls without any selfreproach         5.723909395558857
 this matter may be considered therefore as finally settled         23.235049395546447
 and rising as she thus spoke she would have quitted the room had not mr         8.830141138046141
 collins thus addressed her when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character         4.198313409750447
 really mr         410.7807030195365
 you must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course         5.336103833907082
 my situation in life my connections with the family of de bourgh and my relationship to your own are circumstances highly in my favour and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you         4.024238459088586
 your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications         8.304894213117228
 as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me i shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense according to the usual practice of elegant females         4.8672349660376195
 i do assure you sir that i have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man         6.537394812318733
 i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere         12.278714280111265
 i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals but to accept them is absolutely impossible         4.959563816809451
 my feelings in every respect forbid it         20.892270947956742
 can i speak plainer         118.04644839423219
 you are uniformly charming         257.74521499839403
 cried he with an air of awkward gallantry and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents my proposals will not fail of being acceptable         5.3564369839967165
 to such perseverance in wilful selfdeception elizabeth would make no reply and immediately and in silence withdrew determined if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement to apply to her father whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female         4.706076064588238
 chapter xx         19116.684305283274
 collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love for mrs         8.144568424976818
 bennet having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase than she entered the breakfastroom and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection         5.272491121126781
 collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character         4.622858160808064
 this information however startled mrs         81.87571182257547
 bennetshe would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals but she dared not to believe it and could not help saying so         5.207851644071378
 but depend upon it mr         48.685519338623116
 collins she added that lizzy shall be brought to reason         12.696029996922299
 she is a very headstrong foolish girl and does not know her own interest but i will make her know it         5.268892723288767
 pardon me for interrupting you madam cried mr         23.930775316587034
 collins but if she is really headstrong and foolish i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state         5.443170366378487
 sir you quite misunderstand me said mrs         31.42187423819747
 lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these         12.602050826666366
 in every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived         9.43465455446669
 i will go directly to mr         31.983684065004848
 she would not give him time to reply but hurrying instantly to her husband called out as she entered the library oh         5.395254666722929
 bennet you are wanted immediately we are all in an uproar         11.653085845519128
 you must come and make lizzy marry mr         19.974137947048565
 collins for she vows she will not have him and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her         3.9007219288349444
 bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication         5.433818642882306
 i have not the pleasure of understanding you said he when she had finished her speech         5.194077988098058
 of what are you talking         24.92720594865006
 of mr         79.38452635533254
 collins and lizzy         250.84732898656546
 lizzy declares she will not have mr         39.681263871923385
 collins and mr         125.26210386487823
 and what am i to do on the occasion         9.664138446982665
it seems an hopeless business         63.12199744979499
 speak to lizzy about it yourself         37.65004920408334
 tell her that you insist upon her marrying him         9.753090275846393
 she shall hear my opinion         68.51858037178184
 bennet rang the bell and miss elizabeth was summoned to the library         13.13163967645307
 come here child cried her father as she appeared         29.091379437350383
 i have sent for you on an affair of importance         15.748638813661564
 i understand that mr         78.39640960745986
 collins has made you an offer of marriage         13.615350322374889
 is it true         331.39742424223124
 elizabeth replied that it was         38.18725936906909
 very welland this offer of marriage you have refused         27.365963742799337
 i have sir         289.6444802913268
 we now come to the point         33.96632120665498
 your mother insists upon your accepting it         71.0355830589175
 is not it so mrs         29.89197514776791
 yes or i will never see her again         15.354479613543619
 an unhappy alternative is before you elizabeth         63.55684700843056
 from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents         11.031951639469098
your mother will never see you again if you do not marry mr         4.795724552995024
 collins and i will never see you again if you do         3.9763775204439793
 elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning but mrs         7.5099125793860315
 bennet who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished was excessively disappointed         7.895941011155106
 what do you mean mr         25.7810433516751
 bennet by talking in this way         40.0800630064128
 you promised me to insist upon her marrying him         12.025375758530943
 my dear replied her husband i have two small favours to request         13.255857947730208
 first that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion and secondly of my room         6.395477445752956
 i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be         8.46021770565568
 not yet however in spite of her disappointment in her husband did mrs         8.873579155469173
 bennet give up the point         74.58039961447497
 she talked to elizabeth again and again coaxed and threatened her by turns         8.686758893959079
 she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest but jane with all possible mildness declined interferingand elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks         5.969005610666025
 though her manner varied however her determination never did         16.245481180585607
 he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him and though his pride was hurt he suffered in no other way         5.889825871183319
 his regard for her was quite imaginary and the possibility of her deserving her mothers reproach prevented his feeling any regret         6.747044756680636
 while the family were in this confusion charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them         8.821448223339518
 she was met in the vestibule by lydia who flying to her cried in a half whisper i am glad you are come for there is such fun here         4.446813777949475
what do you think has happened this morning         12.488354168964987
mr         193.63653136531366
 collins has made an offer to lizzy and she will not have him         8.940734338751827
 charlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by kitty who came to tell the same news and no sooner had they entered the breakfastroom where mrs         5.773076888004307
 bennet was alone than she likewise began on the subject calling on miss lucas for her compassion and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family         5.693100607547049
 pray do my dear miss lucas she added in a melancholy tone for nobody is on my side nobody takes part with me i am cruelly used nobody feels for my poor nerves         5.7580251520044605
 charlottes reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth         11.338922419126687
 bennet looking as unconcerned as may be and caring no more for us than if we were at york provided she can have her own way         5.767603020387338
i shall not be able to keep youand so i warn you         6.536468019302128
i have done with you from this very day         16.4562439610216
i told you in the library you know that i should never speak to you again and you will find me as good as my word         5.658929553378465
 i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children         13.604395668857912
not that i have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body         8.116195075614964
 people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking         11.964837616797896
 nobody can tell what i suffer         74.15810850734736
but it is always so         30.887909092608194
 those who do not complain are never pitied         25.161263100432368
 her daughters listened in silence to this effusion sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation         7.002817277593965
 she talked on therefore without interruption from any of them till they were joined by mr         7.2789129137745086
 collins who entered with an air more stately than usual and on perceiving whom she said to the girls now i do insist upon it that you all of you hold your tongues and let mr         5.689981859331315
 collins and me have a little conversation together         15.021722362730616
 elizabeth passed quietly out of the room jane and kitty followed but lydia stood her ground determined to hear all she could and charlotte detained first by the civility of mr         5.732758763338198
 bennet thus began the projected conversation         57.14256394318322
oh         4997.666666666667
 collins         760.5144927536231
 my dear madam replied he let us be for ever silent on this point         12.637233959137859
 far be it from me he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure to resent the behaviour of your daughter         5.976421570963122
 resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment and i trust i am resigned         5.10739356867496
 perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation         4.5762593667459734
 you will not i hope consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family my dear madam by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughters favour without having paid yourself and mr         5.4787217882821295
 bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf         10.810260507073329
 my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughters lips instead of your own         8.138780144723523
 but we are all liable to error         22.993935716506684
 i have certainly meant well through the whole affair         16.75557650671748
 my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself with due consideration for the advantage of all your family and if my manner has been at all reprehensible i here beg leave to apologise         5.370838022415639
 chapter xxi         19116.684305283274
 the discussion of mr         75.09520098913042
 collinss offer was now nearly at an end and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother         6.57497007396193
 he scarcely ever spoke to her and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all and especially to her friend         4.149213205865701
 the morrow produced no abatement of mrs         53.87166104459993
 bennets ill humour or ill health         89.46263554335306
 collins was also in the same state of angry pride         15.580316191839096
 elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it         6.865424945287869
 he was always to have gone on saturday and to saturday he still meant to stay         7.696266306198686
 wickham were returned and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball         11.78037328662386
 he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunts where his regret and vexation and the concern of every body was well talked over         5.98789391588605
to elizabeth however he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed         7.758738889935938
 i found said he as the time drew near that i had better not meet mr         6.852705853165059
 darcythat to be in the same room the same party with him for so many hours together might be more than i could bear and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself         5.640172277683304
 she highly approved his forbearance and they had leisure for a full discussion of it and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn and during the walk he particularly attended to her         5.533330716943022
 his accompanying them was a double advantage she felt all the compliment it offered to herself and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother         5.445894394378346
 soon after their return a letter was delivered to miss bennet it came from netherfield and was opened immediately         5.596483844655079
 the envelope contained a sheet of elegant little hot pressed paper well covered with a ladys fair flowing hand and elizabeth saw her sisters countenance change as she read it and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages         6.186477081219944
 jane recollected herself soon and putting the letter away tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs         4.614918117976841
 the whole party have left netherfield by this time and are on their way to town and without any intention of coming back again         6.838342100826179
 you shall hear what she says         44.98011282583279
 she then read the first sentence aloud which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street where mr         5.649992173228355
 hurst had a house         87.26523512993485
 i do not pretend to regret any thing i shall leave in hertfordshire except your society my dearest friend but we will hope at some future period to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence         4.114073490128255
 i depend on you for that         32.11249448605166
 bingleys being there and as to the loss of their society she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his         6.6046288286907995
 but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters         5.038518886916265
mr         193.63653136531366
 bingley will not be detained in london by them         15.322937376419167
 caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into hertfordshire this winter         19.13497380052791
 i will read it to you when my brother left us yesterday he imagined that the business which took him to london might be concluded in three or four days but as we are certain it cannot be so and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again we have determined on following him thither that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel         4.019135499447958
 many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter i wish i could hear that you my dearest friend had any intention of making one in the croud but of that i despair         4.888339053184918
 i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you         5.334875832698175
 it is evident by this added jane that he comes back no more this winter         9.93166630301816
 it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he should         10.163078394847574
 why will you think so         56.407848755554674
 it must be his own doing         25.056249768858578
he is his own master         27.841649267891732
 but you do not know all         19.4639180929433
 i will read you the passage which particularly hurts me         14.989328730821335
 darcy is impatient to see his sister and to confess the truth we are scarcely less eager to meet her again         8.030264457563833
 i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty elegance and accomplishments and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister         5.113961994164703
 i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject but i will not leave the country without confiding them and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable         3.8816488983479855
 my brother admires her greatly already he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing her relations all wish the connection as much as his own and a sisters partiality is not misleading me i think when i call charles most capable of engaging any womans heart         5.2490202002988156
 with all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it am i wrong my dearest jane in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many         5.674254739660867
said jane as she finished it         28.155301550888716
 is it not clear enough         28.33675665489051
does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister that she is perfectly convinced of her brothers indifference and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means most kindly         5.176126984111991
 to put me on my guard         30.62561083916745
 can there be any other opinion on the subject         15.297751872403547
 yes there can for mine is totally different         25.182696985695973
will you hear it         107.92504247261465
 most willingly         3150.1816603022726
 you shall have it in few words         23.101519357968076
 miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy         8.330065995569289
 she follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you         6.148005008588287
 jane shook her head         134.80483332300187
 indeed jane you ought to believe me         25.597527668593003
no one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection         11.517598008018007
 she is not such a simpleton         20.89853666991946
 could she have seen half as much love in mr         11.501591512287423
 darcy for herself she would have ordered her wedding clothes         12.365383667420538
 we are not rich enough or grand enough for them and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage she may have less trouble in achieving a second in which there is certainly some ingenuity and i dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way         4.256068484667651
 but my dearest jane you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you he is very much in love with her friend         3.483102963336084
 if we thought alike of miss bingley replied jane your representation of all this might make me quite easy         8.375549628366542
 but i know the foundation is unjust         20.28140993862949
 caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one and all that i can hope in this case is that she is deceived herself         7.730523970617971
you could not have started a more happy idea since you will not take comfort in mine         5.907098816184996
 believe her to be deceived by all means         10.971207146919213
 but my dear sister can i be happy even supposing the best in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere         5.847684125843488
 you must decide for yourself said elizabeth and if upon mature deliberation you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife i advise you by all means to refuse him         5.661553198488571
said jane faintly smilingyou must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation i could not hesitate         10.390491585120254
 i did not think you wouldand that being the case i cannot consider your situation with much compassion         6.203909561750643
 a thousand things may arise in six months         27.089870180082617
 the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt         6.659204770327791
 she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect         4.781054409853272
 janes temper was not desponding and she was gradually led to hope though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart         6.071389233975418
 they agreed that mrs         106.93131828773394
 bennet should only hear of the departure of the family without being alarmed on the score of the gentlemans conduct but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together         4.132279126454275
 after lamenting it however at some length she had the consolation of thinking that mr         12.508475784855706
 bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that though he had been invited only to a family dinner she would take care to have two full courses         5.017639588185443
 chapter xxii         19116.684305283274
 the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases and again during the chief of the day was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr         4.9997052605182235
 collins         760.5144927536231
 elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her         26.947433012855942
 it keeps him in good humour said she and i am more obliged to you than i can express         7.532769120444139
 charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time         7.169225479961609
 this was very amiable but charlottes kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception ofits object was nothing less than to secure her from any return of mr         5.765502201673118
 collinss addresses by engaging them towards herself         49.17524972158499
 such was miss lucass scheme and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon         4.644318381893683
 he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins from a conviction that if they saw him depart they could not fail to conjecture his design and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise for though feeling almost secure and with reason for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday         4.52763210051911
 his reception however was of the most flattering kind         20.638293401649932
 miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane         7.100880584219187
 but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there         7.959641174159983
 in as short a time as mr         21.09795451477156
 collinss long speeches would allow every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness         4.31606735805327
 the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance and miss lucas who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment cared not how soon that establishment were gained         5.045983311827475
 sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity         6.972942863423055
 collinss present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter to whom they could give little fortune and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair         7.186584375578095
 lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before how many years longer mr         8.933228203097334
 bennet was likely to live and sir william gave it as his decided opinion that whenever mr         8.585571618211508
 collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st         5.352892399835553
 jamess         17491.833333333332
 the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion         13.779189715702612
 the younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlottes dying an old maid         6.095351381181965
 charlotte herself was tolerably composed         52.36610790173886
 she had gained her point and had time to consider of it         12.387100557879503
 her reflections were in general satisfactory         36.906577606940246
 collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable his society was irksome and his attachment to her must be imaginary         5.901740209220328
 but still he would be her husband         20.84154112270773
without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony marriage had always been her object it was the only honourable provision for welleducated young women of small fortune and however uncertain of giving happiness must be their pleasantest preservative from want         5.959396393854777
 this preservative she had now obtained and at the age of twentyseven without having ever been handsome she felt all the good luck of it         6.425401310381716
 the least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person         6.743491795747436
 elizabeth would wonder and probably would blame her and though her resolution was not to be shaken her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation         5.319166229147518
 she resolved to give her the information herself and therefore charged mr         9.583631111792151
 collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family         5.137712500988422
 a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given but it could not be kept without difficulty for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade and he was at the same time exercising great selfdenial for he was longing to publish his prosperous love         3.8444880122217513
 as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family the ceremony of leavetaking was performed when the ladies moved for the night and mrs         4.716501270738798
 bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them         6.092148576500589
 my dear madam he replied this invitation is particularly gratifying because it is what i have been hoping to receive and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible         5.3881927878601195
 bennet who could by no means wish for so speedy a return immediately said but is there not danger of lady catherines disapprobation here my good sir         5.92786292321071
you had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness         9.118803236943647
 my dear sir replied mr         82.90445680922353
 collins i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyships concurrence         4.990238887336765
 you cannot be too much on your guard         18.153879022224064
 risk any thing rather than her displeasure and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again which i should think exceedingly probable stay quietly at home and be satisfied that we shall take no offence         5.706703122623714
 believe me my dear sir my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention and depend upon it you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire         4.861470386897241
 as for my fair cousins though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness not excepting my cousin elizabeth         4.938480714932265
 with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return         7.479264960257898
 bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him         5.842071418809288
 she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her and though by no means so clever as herself she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers he might become a very agreeable companion         4.700468761756497
 miss lucas called soon after breakfast and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before         8.48833049524643
 the possibility of mr         74.00736614699693
 collinss fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two but that charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum and she could not help crying out engaged to mr         4.345074123782473
 collins         760.5144927536231
 my dear charlotteimpossible         3425.802540820685
do you think it incredible that mr         23.832168087700477
 collins should be able to procure any womans good opinion because he was not so happy as to succeed with you         6.781110756686685
 but elizabeth had now recollected herself and making a strong effort for it was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her and that she wished her all imaginable happiness         4.462033698631304
 i see what you are feeling replied charlotteyou must be surprised very much surprisedso lately as mr         8.178629509180137
 but when you have had time to think it all over i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done         5.074792542919366
 i am not romantic you know         30.762966953802458
 i never was         147.9655045418095
 i ask only a comfortable home and considering mr         17.892113718252652
 collinss character connections and situation in life i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state         6.699037703469692
 charlotte did not stay much longer and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard         6.15143583412462
 collinss making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted         9.688239592796341
 she had always felt that charlottes opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage         4.793648911314493
 charlotte the wife of mr         45.44950798677396
 collins was a most humiliating picture         22.78392490662643
and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen         3.986300461137152
 chapter xxiii         19116.684305283274
 elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters reflecting on what she had heard and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it when sir william lucas himself appeared sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family         4.404212850028043
 with many compliments to them and much selfgratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses he unfolded the matterto an audience not merely wondering but incredulous for mrs         6.491500355674202
 bennet with more perseverance than politeness protested he must be entirely mistaken and lydia always unguarded and often uncivil boisterously exclaimed good lord         6.5083293979399475
 sir william how can you tell such a story         30.806691364201434
do not you know that mr         26.583402126640856
 collins wants to marry lizzy         60.599586326334745
 nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment but sir williams good breeding carried him through it all and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy         5.1545590158509835
 elizabeth feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation now put herself forward to confirm his account by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william in which she was readily joined by jane and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match the excellent character of mr         4.324893870530807
 collins and the convenient distance of hunsford from london         10.285499346649539
 bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent         4.777150356287373
 in the first place she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter secondly she was very sure that mr         4.993717424768853
 collins had been taken in thirdly she trusted that they would never be happy together and fourthly that the match might be broken off         6.185309549847228
 two inferences however were plainly deduced from the whole one that elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief and the other that she herself had been barbarously used by them all and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day         5.2376646896823855
 nothing could console and nothing appease her         44.237371987550304
nor did that day wear out her resentment         19.502037594883134
 a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter         6.133066963951232
 bennets emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort for it gratified him he said to discover that charlotte lucas whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible was as foolish as his wife and more foolish than his daughter         5.053602181756688
 jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable         5.7821223002533255
 kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas for mr         13.00168185578561
 collins was only a clergyman and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton         5.7355530896258875
 lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mrs         9.864483611846293
 bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was though mrs         6.013646607089841
 bennets sour looks and illnatured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away         20.45568912250018
 between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again         5.569382108595404
 her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious as bingley had now been gone a week and nothing was heard of his return         4.833609461234123
 the promised letter of thanks from mr         27.333135679486087
 collins arrived on tuesday addressed to their father and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonths abode in the family might have prompted         6.428076431358506
 after discharging his conscience on that head he proceeded to inform them with many rapturous expressions of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour miss lucas and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight for lady catherine he added so heartily approved his marriage that she wished it to take place as soon as possible which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men         3.913758386537037
 collinss return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to mrs         12.819680079560024
 on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband         11.306685477088992
it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome         5.595817738974626
 such were the gentle murmurs of mrs         15.609690784323563
 bennet and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr         8.888206690010074
 bingleys continued absence         1858.7698298523994
 neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject         23.845468273630637
 bennet and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood         8.23394371388976
 even elizabeth began to fearnot that bingley was indifferentbut that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away         8.639852437505615
 unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of janes happiness and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover she could not prevent its frequently recurring         6.076158752785298
 the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london might be too much she feared for the strength of his attachment         6.238802731397465
 as for jane her anxiety under this suspence was of course more painful than elizabeths but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing and between herself and elizabeth therefore the subject was never alluded to         5.162746495643169
 but as no such delicacy restrained her mother an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley express her impatience for his arrival or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back she should think herself very ill used         4.399193043654764
 it needed all janes steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity         12.557640638069438
 collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction         6.6296341605906175
 he was too happy however to need much attention and luckily for the others the business of lovemaking relieved them from a great deal of his company         5.078077029636338
 the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed         5.456728307182206
 bennet was really in a most pitiable state         19.226537259354224
 the very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of         5.915499964749157
 as her successor in that house she regarded her with jealous abhorrence         15.202853167938576
 collins was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house as soon as mr         4.337588691668689
 bennet were dead         1232.9138318483715
 she complained bitterly of all this to her husband         43.64427331964612
 indeed mr         439.2983401644106
 bennet said she it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house that i should be forced to make way for her and live to see her take my place in it         3.838215403477893
 let us hope for better things         62.01307121420379
 this was not very consoling to mrs         16.837184682769568
 bennet and therefore instead of making any answer she went on as before i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate         5.875018879292894
 what should not you mind         44.75274404603254
 let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility         10.982544332871054
 i never can be thankful mr         33.99113024844821
 bennet for any thing about the entail         19.718543790170035
 how any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from ones own daughters i cannot understand and all for the sake of mr         5.557080941607559
why should he have it more than anybody else         18.02572133639802
 i leave it to yourself to determine said mr         13.521113334026824

 miss bingleys letter arrived and put an end to doubt         14.853854902561364
 the very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for the winter and concluded with her brothers regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left the country         4.8241425050061535
 hope was over entirely over and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter she found little except the professed affection of the writer that could give her any comfort         4.772575880685738
 miss darcys praise occupied the chief of it         32.791607676072374
 her many attractions were again dwelt on and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter         6.174426228470783
 she wrote also with great pleasure of her brothers being an inmate of mr         10.487270053686624
 darcys house and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture         8.874625267833672
 elizabeth to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this heard it in silent indignation         7.516094879103675
 her heart was divided between concern for her sister and resentment against all the others         8.255174131967458
 to carolines assertion of her brothers being partial to miss darcy she paid no credit         11.13919933381591
 that he was really fond of jane she doubted no more than she had ever done and much as she had always been disposed to like him she could not think without anger hardly without contempt on that easiness of temper that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations         4.192549468269093
 it was a subject in short on which reflection would be long indulged and must be unavailing         6.490089609081879
 she could think of nothing else and yet whether bingleys regard had really died away or were suppressed by his friends interference whether he had been aware of janes attachment or whether it had escaped his observation whichever were the case though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference her sisters situation remained the same her peace equally wounded         4.257104743156713
 bennets leaving them together after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master she could not help saying oh         6.589036031708179
 that my dear mother had more command over herself she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him         5.520082648104634
 but i will not repine         20.896258642924636
 it cannot last long         140.0770471914096
 he will be forgot and we shall all be as we were before         8.992631295916674
 elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude but said nothing         12.409793836883644
 you doubt me cried jane slightly colouring indeed you have no reason         11.841745084326083
 he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance but that is all         8.781137055389252
 i have nothing either to hope or fear and nothing to reproach him with         9.105535338305526
 thank god         10250.450497244907
 i have not that pain         32.751974533915664
 a little time therefore         89.46697943230927
i shall certainly try to get the better         17.503381502696424
 my dear jane         444.40076219631834
 exclaimed elizabeth you are too good         46.136488741296525
 your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic i do not know what to say to you         5.214939667053665
 i feel as if i had never done you justice or loved you as you deserve         8.266437707676863
 miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit and threw back the praise on her sisters warm affection         11.543361440970443
 nay said elizabeth this is not fair         35.81647839091842
 you wish to think all the world respectable and are hurt if i speak ill of any body         6.891578611660631
 i only want to think you perfect and you set yourself against it         10.747917750791727
 you need not         368.6634525077854
 there are few people whom i really love and still fewer of whom i think well         9.046194279394289
 i have met with two instances lately one i will not mention the other is charlottes marriage         8.597747881393126
 it is unaccountable         1354.291647458744
 my dear lizzy do not give way to such feelings as these         10.741406687302366
 they will ruin your happiness         103.0684776343067
 you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper         8.768598887065094
 collinss respectability and charlottes prudent steady character         39.32008766098638
 remember that she is one of a large family that as to fortune it is a most eligible match and be ready to believe for every bodys sake that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin         4.863798434343726
 to oblige you i would try to believe almost any thing but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him i should only think worse of her understanding than i now do of her heart         5.177416195171938
 my dear jane mr         136.15265089473505
 collins is a conceited pompous narrowminded silly man you know he is as well as i do and you must feel as well as i do that the woman who marries him cannot have a proper way of thinking         3.935489420323192
 you shall not defend her though it is charlotte lucas         13.109725604343819
 you shall not for the sake of one individual change the meaning of principle and integrity nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me that selfishness is prudence and insensibility of danger security for happiness         4.928622531282694
 i must think your language too strong in speaking of both replied jane and i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together         4.782881375145232
 but enough of this         50.17397201350546
 you alluded to something else         45.41342105538169
 i cannot misunderstand you but i intreat you dear lizzy not to pain me by thinking that person to blame and saying your opinion of him is sunk         6.680623529193405
 we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured         10.887317868863146
 we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect         9.04121605941855
 women fancy admiration means more than it does         48.83329742310447
 and men take care that they should         29.31064157522497
 if it is designedly done they cannot be justified but i have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine         5.278586428319186
 i am far from attributing any part of mr         17.068427891855656
 bingleys conduct to design said elizabeth but without scheming to do wrong or to make others unhappy there may be error and there may be misery         6.673563090628056
 and do you impute it to either of those         11.7779518068236
 yes to the last         45.17723950737682
 but if i go on i shall displease you by saying what i think of persons you esteem         7.029444607861733
 stop me whilst you can         243.81147061056265
 you persist then in supposing his sisters influence him         28.441448637373483
 yes in conjunction with his friend         91.20066452694103
 i cannot believe it         140.44942568809802
 they can only wish his happiness and if he is attached to me no other woman can secure it         7.201159559734249
 your first position is false         193.99168223545243
 they may wish many things besides his happiness they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money great connections and pride         5.739299086981716
 beyond a doubt they do wish him to chuse miss darcy replied jane but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing         7.524023457183262
 they have known her much longer than they have known me no wonder if they love her better         8.432558106517886
 but whatever may be their own wishes it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brothers         8.475369399204295
 what sister would think herself at liberty to do it unless there were something very objectionable         9.026056103871392
 if they believed him attached to me they would not try to part us if he were so they could not succeed         7.552660277207521
 by supposing such an affection you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong and me most unhappy         9.186071667833852
 do not distress me by the idea         34.42265093180297
 i am not ashamed of having been mistakenor at least it is slight it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters         5.207899774194516
 let me take it in the best light in the light in which it may be understood         9.486298553111052
 elizabeth could not oppose such a wish and from this time mr         10.133254646666197
 bingleys name was scarcely ever mentioned between them         26.10157098082798
 bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity         5.335122135193585
 bennets best comfort was that mr         91.98933806459797
 bingley must be down again in the summer         15.193503193412406
 bennet treated the matter differently         61.20295746376351
 so lizzy said he one day your sister is crossed in love i find         9.86414970520921
 i congratulate her         276.8758606401752
 next to being married a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then         8.134180979493978
 it is something to think of and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions         7.521415449976385
 when is your turn to come         22.78122440238455
 now is your time         80.68874106856245
 here are officers enough at meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country         8.645228483269515
 let wickham be your man         73.37541167348556
 he is a pleasant fellow and would jilt you creditably         9.964917929007235
 thank you sir but a less agreeable man would satisfy me         17.056762231988632
 we must not all expect janes good fortune         19.45777847588073
 true said mr         440.2572107890177
 bennet but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befal you you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it         4.967348628091214
 wickhams society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family         7.447570777061936
 they saw him often and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve         8.549325182485122
 the whole of what elizabeth had already heard his claims on mr         9.500047657802925
 darcy and all that he had suffered from him was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked mr         4.83673589558738
 darcy before they had known any thing of the matter         11.393400326613316
 miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of hertfordshire her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances and urged the possibility of mistakesbut by everybody else mr         5.144155658090386
 darcy was condemned as the worst of men         29.12523754217886
 chapter ii         13367.620200875554
 after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity mr         11.511741734154418
 collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday         10.264210500460749
 the pain of separation however might be alleviated on his side by preparations for the reception of his bride as he had reason to hope that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men         3.6861922855984535
 he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before wished his fair cousins health and happiness again and promised their father another letter of thanks         6.033899953508523
 on the following monday mrs         53.77348440773791
 gardiner was a sensible gentlemanlike man greatly superior to his sister as well by nature as education         7.471513069526629
 the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade and within view of his own warehouses could have been so well bred and agreeable         5.76658935553334
 gardiner who was several years younger than mrs         19.86937772109183
 bennet and mrs         145.3397663999941
 between the two eldest and herself especially there subsisted a very particular regard         10.988743054796046
 they had frequently been staying with her in town         18.03460839383746
 gardiners business on her arrival was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions         11.073932590962638
 when this was done she had a less active part to play         9.934818490325224
 it became her turn to listen         28.775917742178617
 bennet had many grievances to relate and much to complain of         12.286758395428475
 they had all been very illused since she last saw her sister         9.841875617682724
 two of her girls had been on the point of marriage and after all there was nothing in it         5.44684678632685
 i do not blame jane she continued for jane would have got mr         9.25661894510326
 bingley if she could         73.53198342337481
 but lizzy         364.0889546618829
 it is very hard to think that she might have been mr         5.1682751235549595
 collinss wife by this time had not it been for her own perverseness         13.82382255015234
 he made her an offer in this very room and she refused him         8.583660740855294
 the consequence of it is that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have and that longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever         5.350901736157482
 the lucases are very artful people indeed sister         20.227835107916174
 they are all for what they can get         17.588688128856106
 i am sorry to say it of them but so it is         10.130389337962711
 it makes me very nervous and poorly to be thwarted so in my own family and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else         6.584639524265841
 however your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts and i am very glad to hear what you tell us of long sleeves         5.1762508815436705
 gardiner to whom the chief of this news had been given before in the course of jane and elizabeths correspondence with her made her sister a slight answer and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation         4.908292206657557
 when alone with elizabeth afterwards she spoke more on the subject         12.862492093755094
 it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane said she         11.823583760952111
 i am sorry it went off         54.28687873053368
 but these things happen so often         51.14598961895841
 bingley so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks and when accident separates them so easily forgets her that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent         5.9937890573093355
 we do not suffer by accident         34.343508706969835
 it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before         4.540982025572153
 but that expression of violently in love is so hackneyed so doubtful so indefinite that it gives me very little idea         7.219956843557376
 it is as often applied to feelings which arise from an halfhours acquaintance as to a real strong attachment         6.470441736934599
 pray how violent was mr         164.5439150173489
 bingleys love         1476.9865167856642
 he was growing quite inattentive to other people and wholly engrossed by her         9.31541461800354
 every time they met it was more decided and remarkable         14.750700220928646
 at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance and i spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer         6.003901770906267
 is not general incivility the very essence of love         16.83263946239509
of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt         9.29860950221932
 poor jane         1085.4198035083257
 it had better have happened to you lizzy you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner         7.847820997049788
 but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us         5.59375316305694
 change of scene might be of serviceand perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything         8.996778178915385
 elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal and felt persuaded of her sisters ready acquiescence         9.32155129232721
 i hope added mrs         132.9852876105672
 gardiner that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her         10.108447388905772
 we live in so different a part of town all our connections are so different and as you well know we go out so little that it is very improbable they should meet at all unless he really comes to see her         5.414665268149497
 and that is quite impossible for he is now in the custody of his friend and mr         5.126193635293764
 darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london         8.377158194936888
 my dear aunt how could you think of it         22.24869348561938
 darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as gracechurch street but he would hardly think a months ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities were he once to enter it and depend upon it mr         5.044242830617831
 bingley never stirs without him         219.31664722799994
 so much the better         24.882579178625484
 i hope they will not meet at all         18.25030643482174
 she will not be able to help calling         9.056896893008858
 she will drop the acquaintance entirely         55.33960875530086
 but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point as well as the still more interesting one of bingleys being withheld from seeing jane she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her on examination that she did not consider it entirely hopeless         4.049135274015977
 it was possible and sometimes she thought it probable that his affection might be reanimated and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of janes attractions         5.682725817653421
 miss bennet accepted her aunts invitation with pleasure and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time than as she hoped that by carolines not living in the same house with her brother she might occasionally spend a morning with her without any danger of seeing him         5.200479940486655
 the gardiners staid a week at longbourn and what with the philipses the lucases and the officers there was not a day without its engagement         6.797183682634196
 when the engagement was for home some of the officers always made part of it of which officers mr         7.727775771927201
 wickham was sure to be one and on these occasions mrs         14.268590960590677
 gardiner rendered suspicious by elizabeths warm commendation of him narrowly observed them both         23.103172511405973
 without supposing them from what she saw to be very seriously in love their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment         4.649713064846801
 to mrs         124.28056580447613
 gardiner wickham had one means of affording pleasure unconnected with his general powers         11.537329659288332
 about ten or a dozen years ago before her marriage she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire to which he belonged         6.991165773304343
 they had therefore many acquaintance in common and though wickham had been little there since the death of darcys father five years before it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring         4.58993300158805
 gardiner had seen pemberley and known the late mr         19.678294131025847
 darcy by character perfectly well         56.690456686473354
 here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse         29.17796913632512
 in comparing her recollection of pemberley with the minute description which wickham could give and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor she was delighting both him and herself         5.606267830958292
 on being made acquainted with the present mr         21.21528996688195
 fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud illnatured boy         20.887256984540812
 chapter iii         13367.620200875554
 gardiners caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone after honestly telling her what she thought she thus went on you are too sensible a girl lizzy to fall in love merely because you are warned against it and therefore i am not afraid of speaking openly         4.721681162208956
 seriously i would have you be on your guard         18.937191330946074
 do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent         8.035376020356422
 i have nothing to say against him he is a most interesting young man and if he had the fortune he ought to have i should think you could not do better         5.395870456157007
 you have sense and we all expect you to use it         12.971811454049345
 your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct i am sure         11.160600538605737
 my dear aunt this is being serious indeed         28.146404038596625
 yes and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise         10.203098277673774
 well then you need not be under any alarm         13.548910582522819
 i will take care of myself and of mr         15.823030401240139
 wickham too         667.7250217005217
 he shall not be in love with me if i can prevent it         8.678547420269057
 elizabeth you are not serious now         20.188111130808913
 i beg your pardon         88.33842905502856
 i will try again         156.40814267437543
 wickham no i certainly am not         28.330936770169526
 but he is beyond all comparison the most agreeable man i ever sawand if he becomes really attached to mei believe it will be better that he should not         5.27663399276127
 i see the imprudence of it         21.46472643738066
oh         4997.666666666667
 that abominable mr         380.93005990771
my fathers opinion of me does me the greatest honour and i should be miserable to forfeit it         9.297290003022578
 my father however is partial to mr         30.144726514967353
 in short my dear aunt i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy but since we see every day that where there is affection young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist         4.27233024323703
 all that i can promise you therefore is not to be in a hurry         4.7596632458848696
 i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object         6.226555651159103
 when i am in company with him i will not be wishing         6.174853803943434
 in short i will do my best         21.086154158245655
 perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often         6.755841811147896
 at least you should not remind your mother of inviting him         13.611773640100633
 as i did the other day said elizabeth with a conscious smile very true it will be wise in me to refrain from that         6.090282574612319
 but do not imagine that he is always here so often         11.433401879285555
 it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week         6.428291823739286
 you know my mothers ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends         8.553997791948827
 but really and upon my honour i will try to do what i think to be wisest and now i hope you are satisfied         5.121954734166188
 her aunt assured her that she was and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints they parted a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point without being resented         5.281695491360297
 collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the gardiners and jane but as he took up his abode with the lucases his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs         6.139601656456
 his marriage was now fast approaching and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable and even repeatedly to say in an illnatured tone that she wished they might be happy         4.940412741396064
 thursday was to be the wedding day and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit and when she rose to take leave elizabeth ashamed of her mothers ungracious and reluctant good wishes and sincerely affected herself accompanied her out of the room         4.6957045138454
 as they went down stairs together charlotte said i shall depend on hearing from you very often eliza         8.15933079014816
 that you certainly shall         84.01494702499026
 and i have another favour to ask         13.961468353892105
 will you come and see me         32.321156353912464
 we shall often meet i hope in hertfordshire         28.841286014346498
 i am not likely to leave kent for some time         13.392479543197695
 promise me therefore to come to hunsford         32.0937085253827
 elizabeth could not refuse though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit         10.116780495794208
 my father and maria are to come to me in march added charlotte and i hope you will consent to be of the party         4.97872588457585
 indeed eliza you will be as welcome to me as either of them         11.110778225758617
 the wedding took place the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from the church door and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual         5.803308609899307
 elizabeth soon heard from her friend and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been that it should be equally unreserved was impossible         6.127445225509764
 elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent it was for the sake of what had been rather than what was         4.954442763466995
 charlottes first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home how she would like lady catherine and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be though when the letters were read elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen         5.047754114792911
 she wrote cheerfully seemed surrounded with comforts and mentioned nothing which she could not praise         13.17049057621957
 the house furniture neighbourhood and roads were all to her taste and lady catherines behaviour was most friendly and obliging         8.06537651615111
 it was mr         97.49010984877428
 collinss picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the rest         7.303417149551855
 jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in london and when she wrote again elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the bingleys         4.876946723798723
 her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is         9.567576979641172
 jane had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing from caroline         9.582626068086679
 i did not think caroline in spirits were her words but she was very glad to see me and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london         4.554834759834571
 i was right therefore my last letter had never reached her         11.463895079632703
 i enquired after their brother of course         31.756047030678207
 he was well but so much engaged with mr         13.130922397322227
 darcy that they scarcely ever saw him         18.601882027425845
 i found that miss darcy was expected to dinner         13.261921684655475
 i wish i could see her         15.70917404266806
 my visit was not long as caroline and mrs         15.057513094809067
 hurst were going out         219.05774287629302
 elizabeth shook her head over this letter         26.412374460786772
 it convinced her that accident only could discover to mr         12.085159448942234
 bingley her sisters being in town         25.55586616930833
 four weeks passed away and jane saw nothing of him         26.31906413998929
 she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it but she could no longer be blind to miss bingleys inattention         5.123601753234612
 after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her the visitor did at last appear but the shortness of her stay and yet more the alteration of her manner would allow jane to deceive herself no longer         5.1938258868156995
 the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt         7.663242968328236
 my dearest lizzy will i am sure be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment at my expence when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss bingleys regard for me         6.487244426950978
 but my dear sister though the event has proved you right do not think me obstinate if i still assert that considering what her behaviour was my confidence was as natural as your suspicion         5.415569759466446
 i do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me but if the same circumstances were to happen again i am sure i should be deceived again         4.400641132718272
 caroline did not return my visit till yesterday and not a note not a line did i receive in the mean time         7.159944902521498
 i pity though i cannot help blaming her         24.670079684995027
 she was very wrong in singling me out as she did i can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side         5.874506477339985
 but i pity her because she must feel that she has been acting wrong and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it         6.246625416529346
 i need not explain myself farther and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless yet if she feels it it will easily account for her behaviour to me and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf is natural and amiable         4.962204134279961
 i cannot but wonder however at her having any such fears now because if he had at all cared about me we must have met long long ago         6.003236320299714
 he knows of my being in town i am certain from something she said herself and yet it should seem by her manner of talking as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy         4.487237834564179
 i cannot understand it         170.342119929819
 if i were not afraid of judging harshly i should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this         5.655742472828653
 but i will endeavour to banish every painful thought and think only of what will make me happy your affection and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt         4.977967126901434
 let me hear from you very soon         37.140259825680374
 miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again of giving up the house but not with any certainty         6.471304524300078
 we had better not mention it         37.897488203975996
 pray go to see them with sir william and maria         15.812272574509699
 i am sure you will be very comfortable there         16.435777529807186
 this letter gave elizabeth some pain but her spirits returned as she considered that jane would no longer be duped by the sister at least         6.6839257339680325
 all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over         18.58444310608867
 she would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions         10.081341122641938
 his character sunk on every review of it and as a punishment for him as well as a possible advantage to jane she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr         6.038739837228406
 darcys sister as by wickhams account she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away         9.028067533673067
 gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman and required information and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself         5.457449998836269
 his apparent partiality had subsided his attentions were over he was the admirer of some one else         11.093745285640463
 elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all but she could see it and write of it without material pain         8.438465795306726
 her heart had been but slightly touched and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice had fortune permitted it         5.404829711396851
 the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable but elizabeth less clearsighted perhaps in his case than in charlottes did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence         5.932515459010675
 all this was acknowledged to mrs         23.272027938127724
 gardiner and after relating the circumstances she thus went oni am now convinced my dear aunt that i have never been much in love for had i really experienced that pure and elevating passion i should at present detest his very name and wish him all manner of evil         4.954020107875769
 but my feelings are not only cordial towards him they are even impartial towards miss king         7.980925031485858
 i cannot find out that i hate her at all or that i am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl         5.24515544290146
 my watchfulness has been effectual and though i should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance were i distractedly in love with him i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance         5.7452801321367595
 kitty and lydia take his defection much more to heart than i do         10.690719120438034
 they are young in the ways of the world and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain         5.433474717874292
 with no greater events than these in the longbourn family and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton sometimes dirty and sometimes cold did january and february pass away         5.743807839339843
 march was to take elizabeth to hunsford         26.699977923332973
 she had not at first thought very seriously of going thither but charlotte she soon found was depending on the plan and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty         5.047574182777842
 absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte again and weakened her disgust of mr         11.94555337273079
 collins         760.5144927536231
 the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane and in short as the time drew near she would have been very sorry for any delay         4.833506777420138
 every thing however went on smoothly and was finally settled according to charlottes first sketch         10.554114751583027
 she was to accompany sir william and his second daughter         8.440379448130548
 the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time and the plan became perfect as plan could be         6.772190138712491
 the only pain was in leaving her father who would certainly miss her and who when it came to the point so little liked her going that he told her to write to him and almost promised to answer her letter         5.205911856085672
 wickham was perfectly friendly on his side even more         18.578742830514145
 his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention the first to listen and to pity the first to be admired and in his manner of bidding her adieu wishing her every enjoyment reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh and trusting their opinion of hertheir opinion of every bodywould always coincide there was a solicitude an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard and she parted from him convinced that whether married or single he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing         4.122069765899883
 her fellowtravellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable         8.99323581219755
 sir william lucas and his daughter maria a good humoured girl but as emptyheaded as himself had nothing to say that could be worth hearing and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise         6.052311388213909
 elizabeth loved absurdities but she had known sir williams too long         24.091709491120827
 he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood and his civilities were worn out like his information         6.736744719006358
 it was a journey of only twentyfour miles and they began it so early as to be in gracechurchstreet by noon         5.400156938777993
 as they drove to mr         76.33504284817403
 on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls whose eagerness for their cousins appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawingroom and whose shyness as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth prevented their coming lower         4.894572880984057
 the day passed most pleasantly away the morning in bustle and shopping and the evening at one of the theatres         7.494353748398751
 elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt         33.19701600071473
 gardiner then rallied her niece on wickhams desertion and complimented her on bearing it so well         13.125309183269199
 but my dear elizabeth she added what sort of girl is miss king         9.269903315501315
 pray my dear aunt what is the difference in matrimonial affairs between the mercenary and the prudent motive         9.225034445925262
 where does discretion end and avarice begin         60.71708491722273
 last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me because it would be imprudent and now because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds you want to find out that he is mercenary         5.617796204663636
 if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is i shall know what to think         6.233353428380441
 she is a very good kind of girl i believe         7.388654783587304
 but he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfathers death made her mistress of this fortune         8.136038402378988
 nowhy should he         1283.7509422414726
 if it was not allowable for him to gain my affections because i had no money what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about and who was equally poor         4.442815901292231
 but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event         10.346474067122116
 a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe         7.101293918432898
 if she does not object to it why should we         9.554646379723229
 her not objecting does not justify him         35.22247859400857
 it only shews her being deficient in something herselfsense or feeling         16.556767956325686
 well cried elizabeth have it as you choose         22.615053050451262
 he shall be mercenary and she shall be foolish         14.726291957393073
 no lizzy that is what i do not choose         14.749388474297929
 i should be sorry you know to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire         4.044256063126561
 if that is all i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in derbyshire and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much better         5.67364227733711
 i am sick of them all         51.17067066020014
 thank heaven         9166.798742175653
 i am going tomorrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him         6.691217512497175
 stupid men are the only ones worth knowing after all         28.089648843305312
 before they were separated by the conclusion of the play she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer         4.664006524852947
 we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us said mrs         10.175180109539626
 gardiner but perhaps to the lakes         42.32479218601282
 no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful         7.294856050519452
 my dear dear aunt she rapturously cried what delight         21.002040393810642
 what felicity         1042.0558722155222
 you give me fresh life and vigour         22.8846468343955
 adieu to disappointment and spleen         114.25263783166415
 what are men to rocks and mountains         33.153527010985144
 what hours of transport we shall spend         22.272000223364024
 and when we do return it shall not be like other travellers without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing         6.310033055335747
 we will know where we have gonewe will recollect what we have seen         10.27321905173913
 let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers         12.544795184465983
 every object in the next days journey was new and interesting to elizabeth and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight         4.159748866805644
 when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford every eye was in search of the parsonage and every turning expected to bring it in view         6.260406330489115
 the paling of rosings park was their boundary on one side         10.434037085146937
 elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants         6.7099102065885665
 at length the parsonage was discernible         35.931005434657024
 the garden sloping to the road the house standing in it the green pales and the laurel hedge every thing declared they were arriving         8.742768057708664
 collins and charlotte appeared at the door and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party         4.654619225331078
 in a moment they were all out of the chaise rejoicing at the sight of each other         7.757707971655902
 collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately received         6.725493693780639
 they were then with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance taken into the house and as soon as they were in the parlour he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode and punctually repeated all his wifes offers of refreshment         3.8497257524821173
 elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room its aspect and its furniture he addressed himself particularly to her as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him         4.529721010025429
 but though every thing seemed neat and comfortable she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion         4.7434942867417025
 when mr         247.44436301581914
 collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed which certainly was not unseldom she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte         6.2401082233403615
 once or twice she could discern a faint blush but in general charlotte wisely did not hear         11.121840800032684
 after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room from the sideboard to the fender to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london mr         5.590943020346969
 collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden which was large and well laid out and to the cultivation of which he attended himself         6.952474213953284
 to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise and owned she encouraged it as much as possible         4.736123057085754
 he could number the fields in every direction and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump         8.127061446000932
 but of all the views which his garden or which the country or the kingdom could boast none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house         4.5118996416679575
 from his garden mr         162.23973684054195
 collins would have led them round his two meadows but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost turned back and while sir william accompanied him charlotte took her sister and friend over the house extremely well pleased probably to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husbands help         4.846673081145572
 it was rather small but well built and convenient and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit         5.686838696047512
 when mr         247.44436301581914
 she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country         11.609715447831373
 it was spoken of again while they were at dinner when mr         11.679086561555431
 collins joining in observed yes miss elizabeth you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church and i need not say you will be delighted with her         4.696436088337914
 i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here         6.2735842678488805
 her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming         13.943646186854815
 we dine at rosings twice every week and are never allowed to walk home         11.764772976120401
 i should say one of her ladyships carriages for she has several         11.42746417201921
 lady catherine is a very respectable sensible woman indeed added charlotte and a most attentive neighbour         10.373305244473617
 very true my dear that is exactly what i say         10.426330219758253
 the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news and telling again what had been already written and when it closed elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlottes degree of contentment to understand her address in guiding and composure in bearing with her husband and to acknowledge that it was all done very well         4.287671629897516
 she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass the quiet tenor of their usual employments the vexatious interruptions of mr         6.791107235108336
 collins and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings         10.219464726066098
 about the middle of the next day as she was in her room getting ready for a walk a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion and after listening a moment she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry and calling loudly after her         4.887856758122695
 she opened the door and met maria in the landing place who breathless with agitation cried out oh my dear eliza         6.198498986774769
 pray make haste and come into the diningroom for there is such a sight to be seen         10.604842922190326
 i will not tell you what it is         14.771834139211581
 make haste and come down this moment         31.633180937636098
 elizabeth asked questions in vain maria would tell her nothing more and down they ran into the diningroom which fronted the lane in quest of this wonder it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate         5.878740304575917
 and is this all         44.50985278087785
 i expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden and here is nothing but lady catherine and her daughter         5.01312113970831
 the old lady is mrs         65.38652300675209
 jenkinson who lives with them         233.44013349894152
 the other is miss de bourgh         24.06108151788889
 only look at her         116.1676614109645
 she is quite a little creature         29.566283355954436
 who would have thought she could be so thin and small         9.819819982188662
 she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind         11.088437535865799
 why does she not come in         42.38731431455727
 it is the greatest of favours when miss de bourgh comes in         7.075617196700906
 i like her appearance said elizabeth struck with other ideas         11.165931854867583
 she looks sickly and cross         129.13606024831535
yes she will do for him very well         20.368608818480944
 she will make him a very proper wife         18.536851980613253
 collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies and sir william to elizabeths high diversion was stationed in the doorway in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that way         5.096356963590845
 at length there was nothing more to be said the ladies drove on and the others returned into the house         8.321150545879847
 collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune which charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next day         5.53747744847255
 collinss triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete         24.075480069027197
 the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife was exactly what he had wished for and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of lady catherines condescension as he knew not how to admire enough         4.109574988749592
 i confess said he that i should not have been at all surprised by her ladyships asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at rosings         5.587080594931324
 i rather expected from my knowledge of her affability that it would happen         11.630421261825427
 but who could have foreseen such an attention as this         12.663326338086275
 who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after your arrival         6.449081492981172
 i am the less surprised at what has happened replied sir william from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire         4.975599436797902
 about the court such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon         16.654411107637277
 collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect that the sight of such rooms so many servants and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them         6.789310129636037
 when the ladies were separating for the toilette he said to elizabeth do not make yourself uneasy my dear cousin about your apparel         5.379565930004898
 lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and daughter         7.976969645729777
 i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest there is no occasion for any thing more         5.625898302062589
 lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed         13.379507279311674
 she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved         14.966914124970938
 while they were dressing he came two or three times to their different doors to recommend their being quick as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner         5.643956564465943
such formidable accounts of her ladyship and her manner of living quite frightened maria lucas who had been little used to company and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at st         5.306521055781496
 jamess         17491.833333333332
 as the weather was fine they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park         8.282500808059215
every park has its beauty and its prospects and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with though she could not be in such raptures as mr         5.56512367784459
 collins expected the scene to inspire and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh         5.162482928136367
 when they ascended the steps to the hall marias alarm was every moment increasing and even sir william did not look perfectly calm         7.012969889001099
elizabeths courage did not fail her         75.00183746126508
 from the entrance hall of which mr         27.503250609662516
her ladyship with great condescension arose to receive them and as mrs         11.516627560385375
 collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers it was performed in a proper manner without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary         5.7909990875565995
 in spite of having been at st         28.24382964889787
 jamess sir william was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow and take his seat without saying a word and his daughter frightened almost out of her senses sat on the edge of her chair not knowing which way to look         5.337140391105002
 elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene and could observe the three ladies before her composedly         8.647979592401752
lady catherine was a tall large woman with stronglymarked features which might once have been handsome         9.896228347805376
 her air was not conciliating nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank         5.902332574931239
 she was not rendered formidable by silence but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as marked her selfimportance and brought mr         5.617228942252023
 wickham immediately to elizabeths mind and from the observation of the day altogether she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had represented         5.417842176422734
 when after examining the mother in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr         10.397045239165854
 darcy she turned her eyes on the daughter she could almost have joined in marias astonishment at her being so thin and so small         6.713901243047132
 there was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies         12.328627459123746
 miss de bourgh was pale and sickly her features though not plain were insignificant and she spoke very little except in a low voice to mrs         8.16098148393936
 jenkinson in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes         6.512207851106217
 after sitting a few minutes they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view mr         5.923009132124609
 collins attending them to point out its beauties and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer         7.31029311192652
 the dinner was exceedingly handsome and there were all the servants and all the articles of plate which mr         6.825153682594919
 collins had promised and as he had likewise foretold he took his seat at the bottom of the table by her ladyships desire and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater         5.642460618323732
he carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity and every dish was commended first by him and then by sir william who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear         5.1359586774538055
 but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration and gave most gracious smiles especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them         6.8076714626029835
 the party did not supply much conversation         23.5581081953441
 jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate pressing her to try some other dish and fearing she were indisposed         8.287780509052034
 maria thought speaking out of the question and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire         12.211060639088895
 when the ladies returned to the drawingroom there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk which she did without any intermission till coffee came in delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted         4.544887828449409
 she enquired into charlottes domestic concerns familiarly and minutely and gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry         4.142193660337141
 collins was a very genteel pretty kind of girl         12.529360153816217
 she asked her at different times how many sisters she had whether they were older or younger than herself whether any of them were likely to be married whether they were handsome where they had been educated what carriage her father kept and what had been her mothers maiden name         4.867937723867052
elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered them very composedly         10.495465099376794
lady catherine then observed your fathers estate is entailed on mr         18.509984504414618
 collins i think         284.65158267735757
 for your sake turning to charlotte i am glad of it but otherwise i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line         5.7588901501047225
it was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourghs family         9.36020871148294
do you play and sing miss bennet         30.914708732283565
 a little         215.05225786134164
 thensome time or other we shall be happy to hear you         20.918519522163308
 our instrument is a capital one probably superior toyou shall try it some day         12.72398974651058
do your sisters play and sing         39.0497801648741
 one of them does         56.28022655823462
 why did not you all learn         28.982540728650026
you ought all to have learned         33.977465094876855
 the miss webbs all play and their father has not so good an income as yours         11.347636040749347
do you draw         797.0575051171654
 no not at all         57.47607373457262
 what none of you         88.46471326691646
 not one         177.9489480093614
 that is very strange         59.635874173686744
 but i suppose you had no opportunity         24.54013288625214
 your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters         9.998688606990072
 my mother would have had no objection but my father hates london         12.109361596234058
 has your governess left you         103.14216607992526
 we never had any governess         53.2732461926585
 no governess         1454.196323294048
 how was that possible         49.95908336372268
 five daughters brought up at home without a governess         31.524599752130854
i never heard of such a thing         14.264976683762445
 your mother must have been quite a slave to your education         14.042407474446826
 elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been the case         9.060084174186132
 without a governess you must have been neglected         26.967578492304096
 compared with some families i believe we were but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means         8.651216901323293
 we were always encouraged to read and had all the masters that were necessary         9.14664973449597
 those who chose to be idle certainly might         34.162811270124195
 aye no doubt but that is what a governess will prevent and if i had known your mother i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one         6.710114534183159
 i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction and nobody but a governess can give it         5.9742425765061355
 it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way         9.192244749887099
 i am always glad to get a young person well placed out         12.779620660757555
 four nieces of mrs         202.04292568613013
 jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means and it was but the other day that i recommended another young person who was merely accidentally mentioned to me and the family are quite delighted with her         5.418886887618507
 collins did i tell you of lady metcalfes calling yesterday to thank me         9.99014474323184
 she finds miss pope a treasure         70.09257365363318
 lady catherine said she you have given me a treasure         16.364193381467523
 are any of your younger sisters out miss bennet         12.412172491730974
 yes maam all         1089.558075102589
 all         199.1480075901328
what all five out at once         42.792771185714926
 very odd         1712.94533278045
and you only the second         28.13933276310864
the younger ones out before the elder are married         22.872795041787377
your younger sisters must be very young         39.97958889838093
 yes my youngest is not sixteen         65.08790807927494
 perhaps she is full young to be much in company         13.151071082079557
 but really maam i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early         5.0878880366474215
the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first         10.104326441108388
 and to be kept back on such a motive         9.094896694420456
i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind         5.88751242049569
 upon my word said her ladyship you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person         9.278595815100656
pray what is your age         74.23238366857225
 with three younger sisters grown up replied elizabeth smiling your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it         9.23536183130922
 you cannot be more than twenty i am suretherefore you need not conceal your age         8.867071665517459
 i am not one and twenty         23.236476832285692
 when the gentlemen had joined them and tea was over the card tables were placed         9.503923153007271
 lady catherine sir william and mr         72.71697179964886
 collins sat down to quadrille and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino the two girls had the honour of assisting mrs         6.784624124779712
 jenkinson to make up her party         35.81897780557457
 scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game except when mrs         12.878325719155866
 jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de bourghs being too hot or too cold or having too much or too little light         8.288085597595376
 a great deal more passed at the other table         15.069345974332661
 lady catherine was generally speakingstating the mistakes of the three others or relating some anecdote of herself         9.118019357591391
 sir william did not say much         64.3400895150626
 he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names         20.488716771339085
 when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose the tables were broke up the carriage was offered to mrs         5.631732745554552
 collins gratefully accepted and immediately ordered         107.84517842011566
 from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr         8.500642137910301
 as soon as they had driven from the door elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings which for charlottes sake she made more favourable than it really was         4.18143396627054
 but her commendation though costing her some trouble could by no means satisfy mr         9.329356650547009
 collins and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyships praise into his own hands         7.248127892300819
 chapter vii         14675.902278985472
 sir william staid only a week at hunsford but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughters being most comfortably settled and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with         6.50495597186789
 while sir william was with them mr         54.57463350713157
 collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig and shewing him the country but when he went away the whole family returned to their usual employments and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writing and looking out of window in his own book room which fronted the road         4.304125865728361
 collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement         7.325075894522783
 from the drawingroom they could distinguish nothing in the lane and were indebted to mr         9.746443656358204
 collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton which he never failed coming to inform them of though it happened almost every day         5.087622779640066
 she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage and had a few minutes conversation with charlotte but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out         7.008660444650467
 collins did not walk to rosings and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours         4.908662313482013
 now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits         5.722956996291866
 she examined into their employments looked at their work and advised them to do it differently found fault with the arrangement of the furniture or detected the housemaid in negligence and if she accepted any refreshment seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that mrs         4.950973034122252
 collinss joints of meat were too large for her family         24.759889844616936
 elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county she was a most active magistrate in her own parish the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by mr         5.082608218713082
 collins and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome discontented or too poor she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences silence their complaints and scold them into harmony and plenty         5.6165324441452285
 the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week and allowing for the loss of sir william and there being only one card table in the evening every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first         5.104419267386691
 their other engagements were few as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general was beyond the collinses reach         8.526205071148464
 this however was no evil to elizabeth and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough there were half hours of pleasant conversation with charlotte and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment out of doors         4.584920949239072
 her favourite walk and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine was along the open grove which edged that side of the park where there was a nice sheltered path which no one seemed to value but herself and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherines curiosity         4.898878956534573
 in this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away         11.947926736615265
 easter was approaching and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at rosings which in so small a circle must be important         7.351253505122667
 elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that mr         16.44758818474958
 darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingleys designs on him were by his behaviour to his cousin for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself         3.7953320701498656
 collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane in order to have the earliest assurance of it and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park hurried home with the great intelligence         5.044047809267915
 on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects         9.9522534439708
 there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them for mr         11.800538052800484
 darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam the younger son of his uncle lord and to the great surprise of all the party when mr         6.1556116795893345
 collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him         31.674921393042656
 darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me         11.30092749342275
 elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment before their approach was announced by the doorbell and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room         6.1519421439245745
 colonel fitzwilliam who led the way was about thirty not handsome but in person and address most truly the gentleman         9.500843122664682
 darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshire paid his compliments with his usual reserve to mrs         4.751402280323414
 collins and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend met her with every appearance of composure         8.491547794914023
 elizabeth merely curtseyed to him without saying a word         27.541509077572
 colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a wellbred man and talked very pleasantly but his cousin after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to mrs         6.494210176326261
 collins sat for some time without speaking to any body         11.658087182349833
 she answered him in the usual way and after a moments pause added my eldest sister has been in town these three months         6.5966150729629645
 she was perfectly sensible that he never had but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet         3.6971765508631997
 the subject was pursued no farther and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away         9.129976858737026
 colonel fitzwilliams manners were very much admired at the parsonage and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at rosings         7.607372605898311
 it was some days however before they received any invitation thither for while there were visitors in the house they could not be necessary and it was not till easterday almost a week after the gentlemens arrival that they were honoured by such an attention and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening         4.2039091744871735
 for the last week they had seen very little of either lady catherine or her daughter         6.982054028111801
 colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time but mr         10.712073358688334
 darcy they had only seen at church         20.33139692353579
 the invitation was accepted of course and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherines drawingroom         6.857351693833275
 her ladyship received them civilly but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else and she was in fact almost engrossed by her nephews speaking to them especially to darcy much more than to any other person in the room         4.4895374304070135
 colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them any thing was a welcome relief to him at rosings and mrs         8.619465900965617
 collinss pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much         24.82742183112372
 he now seated himself by her and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire of travelling and staying at home of new books and music that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before and they conversed with so much spirit and flow as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself as well as of mr         4.301897336495351
 his eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling was more openly acknowledged for she did not scruple to call out what is that you are saying fitzwilliam         4.953222858111829
 what is it you are talking of         14.277802833247048
 what are you telling miss bennet         27.972337098605802
 let me hear what it is         41.25432967857789
 we are speaking of music madam said he when no longer able to avoid a reply         9.30302319322281
 of music         625.8240134817905
 then pray speak aloud         346.02547053209304
 it is of all subjects my delight         13.762997240264454
 i must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music         7.582115627944156
 there are few people in england i suppose who have more true enjoyment of music than myself or a better natural taste         7.227689535713263
 if i had ever learnt i should have been a great proficient         9.802744148225651
 and so would anne if her health had allowed her to apply         8.566056569702555
 i am confident that she would have performed delightfully         24.77573260207994
 how does georgiana get on darcy         69.20174591444678
 darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sisters proficiency         16.87347461744701
 i am very glad to hear such a good account of her said lady catherine and pray tell her from me that she cannot expect to excel if she does not practise a great deal         4.470568855921361
 so much the better         24.882579178625484
 it cannot be done too much and when i next write to her i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account         6.4219541457073595
 i have told miss bennet several times that she will never play really well unless she practises more and though mrs         7.270901030433943
 collins has no instrument she is very welcome as i have often told her to come to rosings every day and play on the pianoforte in mrs         6.384291948307185
 jenkinsons room         9008.931976444379
 darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunts ill breeding and made no answer         9.432221064285356
 when coffee was over colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him and she sat down directly to the instrument         7.125785128714177
 he drew a chair near her         29.278661489272903
 lady catherine listened to half a song and then talked as before to her other nephew till the latter walked away from her and moving with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performers countenance         5.768634781348008
 darcy by coming in all this state to hear me         14.464908927269555
 but i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well         6.035296824701786
 there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others         7.063973839396312
 i shall not say that you are mistaken he replied because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own         4.336506767981413
 elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself and said to colonel fitzwilliam your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me and teach you not to believe a word i say         6.54914898284367
 i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character in a part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit         5.914818532931168
 indeed mr         439.2983401644106
 darcy it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshireand give me leave to say very impolitic toofor it is provoking me to retaliate and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear         4.607720511908655
 i am not afraid of you said he smilingly         8.519690318736568
 pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of cried colonel fitzwilliam         10.97381302686927
 i should like to know how he behaves among strangers         12.699559199246538
 you shall hear thenbut prepare yourself for something very dreadful         17.061976913500093
 the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire you must know was at a balland at this ball what do you think he did         5.49267453439531
 he danced only four dances         42.14558198997535
 i am sorry to pain youbut so it was         16.889419432344596
 he danced only four dances though gentlemen were scarce and to my certain knowledge more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner         5.670101547135883
 i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party         6.467878898525295
 true and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room         15.450301604892557
 well colonel fitzwilliam what do i play next         34.07171089353799
 perhaps said darcy i should have judged better had i sought an introduction but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers         6.876389974305396
 shall we ask your cousin the reason of this         19.80626938748548
 said elizabeth still addressing colonel fitzwilliam         41.48508785876287
 shall we ask him why a man of sense and education and who has lived in the world is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers         6.368843246310079
 i can answer your question said fitzwilliam without applying to him         13.773076359141955
 it is because he will not give himself the trouble         13.405777239076478
 i certainly have not the talent which some people possess said darcy of conversing easily with those i have never seen before         6.733497533156237
 i cannot catch their tone of conversation or appear interested in their concerns as i often see done         10.368385942295099
 my fingers said elizabeth do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many womens do         8.86752005657388
 they have not the same force or rapidity and do not produce the same expression         8.225377654369542
 but then i have always supposed it to be my own faultbecause i would not take the trouble of practising         6.835450090560556
 it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other womans of superior execution         5.118900595970553
 darcy smiled and said you are perfectly right         19.694639666495988
 you have employed your time much better         33.58342120350804
 no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think any thing wanting         12.073503424839306
 here they were interrupted by lady catherine who called out to know what they were talking of         6.482389459950708
 elizabeth immediately began playing again         78.91739017929926
 lady catherine approached and after listening for a few minutes said to darcy miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more and could have the advantage of a london master         6.118130870985526
 she has a very good notion of fingering though her taste is not equal to annes         7.307893922758551
 anne would have been a delightful performer had her health allowed her to learn         10.420815603445034
 elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousins praise but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley that he might have been just as likely to marry her had she been his relation         4.222683291554046
 lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeths performance mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste         11.162397440879847
 chapter ix         14675.902278985472
 elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning and writing to jane while mrs         9.041255622975626
 collins and maria were gone on business into the village when she was startled by a ring at the door the certain signal of a visitor         6.5066140787243025
 as she had heard no carriage she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine and under that apprehension was putting away her halffinished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions when the door opened and to her very great surprise mr         4.826996231052669
 darcy and mr         100.27821457661189
 darcy only entered the room         79.64773956557951
 they then sat down and when her enquiries after rosings were made seemed in danger of sinking into total silence         8.299391346050628
 it was absolutely necessary therefore to think of something and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure she observed how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november mr         4.298796029669121
 bingley to see you all after him so soon for if i recollect right he went but the day before         7.023478379969289
 he and his sisters were well i hope when you left london         7.6031057585844835
 perfectly soi thank you         1313.2304078825118
 she found that she was to receive no other answerand after a short pause added i think i have understood that mr         5.8209115564664495
 bingley has not much idea of ever returning to netherfield again         10.539848216194638
 he has many friends and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing         7.591964996361303
 if he means to be but little at netherfield it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then we might possibly get a settled family there         5.282337443088657
 bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle         5.17609618044507
 i should not be surprised said darcy if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers         6.13120633717835
 elizabeth made no answer         61.07913978034581
 she was afraid of talking longer of his friend and having nothing else to say was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him         5.264427679219112
 he took the hint and soon began with this seems a very comfortable house         8.387819743656477
 lady catherine i believe did a great deal to it when mr         10.229689999710812
 collins first came to hunsford         86.50294615398555
 i believe she didand i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object         5.623660756770127
 collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife         19.224798665484933
 yes indeed his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made him happy if they had         5.736751872222796
 collins as the wisest thing she ever did         13.294525956154425
 she seems perfectly happy however and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her         8.73228526969599
 it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends         5.990987843777405
 it is nearly fifty miles         73.07068555241263
 and what is fifty miles of good road         13.493193867065411
 little more than half a days journey         19.610831584553722
 yes i call it a very easy distance         26.028758434680782
 i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match cried elizabeth         5.380198969906056
 i should never have said mrs         24.759702932591587
 collins was settled near her family         39.57378044484164
 any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of longbourn i suppose would appear far         13.32457788173358
 as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she understood he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and netherfield and she blushed as she answered i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family         4.820789420547284
 the far and the near must be relative and depend on many varying circumstances         7.8050813851319205
 where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant distance becomes no evil         9.560826993829439
 collins have a comfortable income but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeysand i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance         5.190153409549211
 darcy drew his chair a little towards her and said you cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment         7.438250808174184
 you cannot have been always at longbourn         23.56586819887155
 elizabeth looked surprised         778.5117766590392
 the gentleman experienced some change of feeling he drew back his chair took a newspaper from the table and glancing over it said in a colder voice are you pleased with kent         6.5258828534152915
 a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued on either side calm and conciseand soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister just returned from their walk         4.396988043045165
 the têteàtête surprised them         229.51587052813971
 darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body went away         5.630912443849173
 what can be the meaning of this         10.851851091817942
 said charlotte as soon as he was gone         12.702870954636964
 my dear eliza he must be in love with you or he would never have called on us in this familiar way         6.9515222417742795
 but when elizabeth told of his silence it did not seem very likely even to charlottes wishes to be the case and after various conjectures they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do which was the more probable from the time of year         4.613276577993459
 they called at various times of the morning sometimes separately sometimes together and now and then accompanied by their aunt         7.24876587042281
 it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society a persuasion which of course recommended him still more and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him as well as by his evident admiration of her of her former favourite george wickham and though in comparing them she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliams manners she believed he might have the best informed mind         4.521830169410036
 but why mr         284.1184841814726
 darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult to understand         10.512070132609825
 it could not be for society as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips and when he did speak it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choicea sacrifice to propriety not a pleasure to himself         4.677639998383253
 he seldom appeared really animated         106.45004772341639
 collins knew not what to make of him         19.23309192567053
she watched him whenever they were at rosings and whenever he came to hunsford but without much success         8.349087350119502
 he certainly looked at her friend a great deal but the expression of that look was disputable         9.008123489214796
 it was an earnest steadfast gaze but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind         5.39973583749426
 she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her but elizabeth always laughed at the idea and mrs         5.890561980895186
 in her kind schemes for elizabeth she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam         9.307972568405686
 he was beyond comparison the pleasantest man he certainly admired her and his situation in life was most eligible but to counterbalance these advantages mr         6.294904178066131
 darcy had considerable patronage in the church and his cousin could have none at all         10.61616976089009
 chapter x         14675.902278985472
 more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park unexpectedly meet mr         10.84918227831222
yet it did and even a third         24.89244491592501
 it seemed like wilful illnature or a voluntary penance for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her         5.233270144417392
 he never said a great deal nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questionsabout her pleasure in being at hunsford her love of solitary walks and her opinion of mr         4.217636029175234
 collinss happiness and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too         5.974473678096499
 his words seemed to imply it         45.11728105188733
 could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts         15.564304008823035
 she was engaged one day as she walked in reperusing janes last letter and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits when instead of being again surprised by mr         5.4914208215157645
 darcy she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her         11.392220168320987
 putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile she said i did not know before that you ever walked this way         5.806361087866558
 i have been making the tour of the park he replied as i generally do every year and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage         5.752314433759088
 are you going much farther         56.65881647854298
 no i should have turned in a moment         16.237279008092205
 and accordingly she did turn and they walked towards the parsonage together         9.692834568028443
 do you certainly leave kent on saturday         27.671049309215736
 said she         174.60291386884307
 yesif darcy does not put it off again         47.47448890086337
 but i am at his disposal         27.8074337890222
 he arranges the business just as he pleases         25.467533109762428
 and if not able to please himself in the arrangement he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice         5.3660623612626255
 i do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr         5.138702678677308
 he likes to have his own way very well replied colonel fitzwilliam         11.144911853451072
 but so we all do         29.926102598112784
 it is only that he has better means of having it than many others because he is rich and many others are poor         5.569239300223218
 i speak feelingly         2362.1915500455425
 a younger son you know must be inured to selfdenial and dependence         14.630944624773747
 in my opinion the younger son of an earl can know very little of either         7.093753205357129
 these are home questionsand perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature         8.140737643295505
 younger sons cannot marry where they like         95.47799149589848
 unless where they like women of fortune which i think they very often do         11.994238696121377
 is this thought elizabeth meant for me         25.197482948944064
 and she coloured at the idea but recovering herself said in a lively tone and pray what is the usual price of an earls younger son         6.268059153115404
 unless the elder brother is very sickly i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds         10.665457337635734
 to interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed she soon afterwards said i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal         4.7343413202723506
 i wonder he does not marry to secure a lasting convenience of that kind         9.095207141295694
 but perhaps his sister does as well for the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what he likes with her         5.766303831321529
 no said colonel fitzwilliam that is an advantage which he must divide with me         10.267564931567252
 i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy         15.557523206692316
 are you indeed         270.0375407535436
 and pray what sort of guardians do you make         17.21957121630612
 does your charge give you much trouble         47.21419676662476
 young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage and if she has the true darcy spirit she may like to have her own way         5.902010715553693
 as she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth         4.339558138159868
 she directly replied you need not be frightened         18.65371223378705
 i never heard any harm of her and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world         4.090916016664655
 she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance mrs         6.381105705719538
 hurst and miss bingley         47.81692064062755
 i think i have heard you say that you know them         4.506980060976767
 i know them a little         44.345427035928154
 their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike manhe is a great friend of darcys         11.119853349739017
 yes said elizabeth drilymr         126.43541682847953
 darcy is uncommonly kind to mr         48.98301038525447
 bingley and takes a prodigious deal of care of him         16.5812683192455
 care of him         221.12537829975122
yes i really believe darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care         8.61895104553272
 from something that he told me in our journey hither i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him         6.394487186084973
 but i ought to beg his pardon for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant         6.236439982129256
 it was all conjecture         45.663236535840845
 what is it you mean         24.514451412559218
 it is a circumstance which darcy of course would not wish to be generally known because if it were to get round to the ladys family it would be an unpleasant thing         4.566226986258853
 you may depend upon my not mentioning it         11.355666672946931
 what he told me was merely this that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage but without mentioning names or any other particulars and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer         4.541637880662019
 did mr         294.04733427953596
 darcy give you his reasons for this interference         19.301442244235137
 i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady         4.841866048650974
 he did not talk to me of his own arts said fitzwilliam smiling         9.196101050489034
 he only told me what i have now told you         10.734700801053062
 elizabeth made no answer and walked on her heart swelling with indignation         7.712190679102056
 after watching her a little fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful         10.892102808488508
 i am thinking of what you have been telling me said she         12.799173755652445
 your cousins conduct does not suit my feelings         35.44090142549602
 why was he to be the judge         20.764119835197
 i do not see what right mr         19.431000337287195
 but she continued recollecting herself as we know none of the particulars it is not fair to condemn him         7.490265548064474
 it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case         4.786388117175282
 that is not an unnatural surmise said fitzwilliam but it is lessening the honour of my cousins triumph very sadly         6.490825871156256
 this was spoken jestingly but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr         9.660792522030311
 darcy that she would not trust herself with an answer and therefore abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage         5.099136001076038
 there shut into her own room as soon as their visitor left them she could think without interruption of all that she had heard         5.719675729899723
 darcy could have such boundless influence         29.921750020345655
 that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate mr         5.226625856115595
 bingley and jane she had never doubted but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them         6.386241314872309
 if his own vanity however did not mislead him he was the cause his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered and still continued to suffer         5.811990993997168
 there were some very strong objections against the lady were colonel fitzwilliams words and these strong objections probably were her having one uncle who was a country attorney and another who was in business in london         4.243789057732277
 to jane herself she exclaimed there could be no possibility of objection         9.832063529795242
 all loveliness and goodness as she is         30.126242294545932
 her understanding excellent her mind improved and her manners captivating         18.936822316951815
 neither could any thing be urged against my father who though with some peculiarities has abilities which mr         8.710184281507091
 darcy himself need not disdain and respectability which he will probably never reach         13.329398309840332
 darcy whose pride she was convinced would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friends connections than from their want of sense and she was quite decided at last that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride and partly by the wish of retaining mr         4.934618575705568
 bingley for his sister         55.61149951002897
 the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a headache and it grew so much worse towards the evening that added to her unwillingness to see mr         5.596070385996931
 darcy it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings where they were engaged to drink tea         8.11314832454628
 collins seeing that she was really unwell did not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her but mr         5.822610314978002
 collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherines being rather displeased by her staying at home         8.107249171331947
 when they were gone elizabeth as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr         6.16439450211496
 darcy chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent         7.226346012575392
 they contained no actual complaint nor was there any revival of past occurrences or any communication of present suffering         8.570279903033077
 but in all and in almost every line of each there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style and which proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly disposed towards every one had been scarcely ever clouded         4.441975208448831
 elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal         7.995708167071629
 darcys shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a keener sense of her sisters sufferings         9.612797076302037
 it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits by all that affection could do         4.145345298966287
 she could not think of darcys leaving kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all and agreeable as he was she did not mean to be unhappy about him         4.4410695125702855
 while settling this point she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself who had once before called late in the evening and might now come to enquire particularly after her         4.968872056979817
 but this idea was soon banished and her spirits were very differently affected when to her utter amazement she saw mr         6.697564484853158
 darcy walk into the room         75.23551616858444
 she answered him with cold civility         29.88982340607199
 he sat down for a few moments and then getting up walked about the room         7.783331772388631
 elizabeth was surprised but said not a word         16.602165011255924
 after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner and thus began in vain have i struggled         7.355572449691028
 it will not do         61.15554805130064
 she stared coloured doubted and was silent         60.37720662501512
 this he considered sufficient encouragement and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately followed         7.435382695392036
 he spoke well but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride         5.3118202070582194
 his sense of her inferiorityof its being a degradationof the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding but was very unlikely to recommend his suit         4.990858091608848
 in spite of her deeplyrooted dislike she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a mans affection and though her intentions did not vary for an instant she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive till roused to resentment by his subsequent language she lost all compassion in anger         4.350904083932767
 she tried however to compose herself to answer him with patience when he should have done         9.667406858233946
 he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand         4.976000014577882
 as he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer         6.246907747334695
 he spoke of apprehension and anxiety but his countenance expressed real security         9.792810239441438
 such a circumstance could only exasperate farther and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks and she said in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however unequally they may be returned         4.817771361622726
 it is natural that obligation should be felt and if i could feel gratitude i would now thank you         7.867208946532548
 but i cannoti have never desired your good opinion and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly         10.877476152313363
 it has been most unconsciously done however and i hope will be of short duration         8.79967715760171
 the feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation         5.795206953337642
 his complexion became pale with anger and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature         10.83933630881716
 he was struggling for the appearance of composure and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it         7.625706709720207
 the pause was to elizabeths feelings dreadful         20.93605691908576
 at length in a voice of forced calmness he said and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting         6.026373217892728
 i might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little endeavour at civility i am thus rejected         8.112781758740997
 but it is of small importance         21.727741487200593
 i might as well enquire replied she why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will against your reason and even against your character         4.861646738671387
 was not this some excuse for incivility if i was uncivil         10.271453386789261
 you know i have         65.78537413238398
 had not my own feelings decided against you had they been indifferent or had they even been favourable do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining perhaps for ever the happiness of a most beloved sister         4.487534214608774
 as she pronounced these words mr         38.628842060836654
 darcy changed colour but the emotion was short and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued         10.248915814159831
 no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there         13.779152599875184
 you dare not you cannot deny that you have been the principal if not the only means of dividing them from each other of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability the other to its derision for disappointed hopes and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind         4.61017172040275
 she paused and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse         6.6192220599015466
 he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity         8.517897153814584
 can you deny that you have done it         23.478521821026014
 she repeated         535.7640595806865
 with assumed tranquillity he then replied i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister or that i rejoice in my success         6.700661129094226
 towards him i have been kinder than towards myself         15.154470155783828
 elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection but its meaning did not escape nor was it likely to conciliate her         7.280848953741529
 but it is not merely this affair she continued on which my dislike is founded         6.739160298677639
 long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided         10.979400142191217
 your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr         8.874783336700267
 on this subject what can you have to say         18.817910736178714
 in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself         15.763410163292676
 or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others         16.246578171432397
 you take an eager interest in that gentlemans concerns said darcy in a less tranquil tone and with a heightened colour         7.13632585820361
 who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in him         10.624125281279921
 and of your infliction cried elizabeth with energy         10.76520475632415
 you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert         8.148274009908114
 and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule         8.247037979227496
 and this cried darcy as he walked with quick steps across the room is your opinion of me         7.540543425678807
 this is the estimation in which you hold me         11.279060077768067
 i thank you for explaining it so fully         16.667778178357498
 my faults according to this calculation are heavy indeed         31.093039552225
 but perhaps added he stopping in his walk and turning towards her these offences might have been overlooked had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design         5.581958797000312
 these bitter accusations might have been suppressed had i with greater policy concealed my struggles and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified unalloyed inclination by reason by reflection by every thing         7.47779214258171
 but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence         20.897634355093697
 nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related         17.220818324431086
 they were natural and just         66.11107304900908
 could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections         10.357073442270055
 to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own         8.847065740426968
 elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said you are mistaken mr         6.704428706005287
 darcy if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner         4.086903706957285
 she saw him start at this but he said nothing and she continued you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it         4.243138058661426
 again his astonishment was obvious and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification         6.166191149228849
 she went on         202.2267252717103
 from the very beginning from the first moment i may almost say of my acquaintance with you your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance your conceit and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others were such as to form that groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry         3.9683234451156113
 you have said quite enough madam         25.8036392215796
 i perfectly comprehend your feelings and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been         8.895948144623057
 and with these words he hastily left the room and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house         6.046064578813415
 she knew not how to support herself and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour         5.194590135185864
 her astonishment as she reflected on what had passed was increased by every review of it         6.558026119688157
 that he should have been in love with her for so many months         6.6175072130301755
 so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friends marrying her sister and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case was almost incredible         4.34790377788451
 it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection         12.589271564063313
 but his pride his abominable pride his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to jane his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging though he could not justify it and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr         4.280792164035231
 wickham his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited         7.244100953263905
 she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady catherines carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlottes observation and hurried her away to her room         5.519500281983775
 chapter xii         14675.902278985472
 she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened it was impossible to think of any thing else and totally indisposed for employment she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise         3.997753900342564
 darcys sometimes coming there stopped her and instead of entering the park she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road         7.8211117401194885
 the park paling was still the boundary on one side and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground         8.443568950603145
 after walking two or three times along that part of the lane she was tempted by the pleasantness of the morning to stop at the gates and look into the park         5.5920096431326245
 the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had made a great difference in the country and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees         6.307024559461584
 she was on the point of continuing her walk when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park he was moving that way and fearful of its being mr         4.252262019952539
 darcy she was directly retreating         30.129194765876235
 but the person who advanced was now near enough to see her and stepping forward with eagerness pronounced her name         7.003067642226906
 she had turned away but on hearing herself called though in a voice which proved it to be mr         7.494674927212134
 darcy she moved again towards the gate         31.191290153091792
 he had by that time reached it also and holding out a letter which she instinctively took said with a look of haughty composure i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you         4.598220197967378
 will you do me the honour of reading that letter         12.698619493810838
 with no expectation of pleasure but with the strongest curiosity elizabeth opened the letter and to her still increasing wonder perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper written quite through in a very close hand         5.6731922038653915
the envelope itself was likewise full         74.35590533452569
pursuing her way along the lane she then began it         20.045648933106325
 it was dated from rosings at eight oclock in the morning and was as follows be not alarmed madam on receiving this letter by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you         5.375166903209715
 i write without any intention of paining you or humbling myself by dwelling on wishes which for the happiness of both cannot be too soon forgotten and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion should have been spared had not my character required it to be written and read         4.48703829251701
 you must therefore pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention your feelings i know will bestow it unwillingly but i demand it of your justice         6.314226880546053
 two offences of a very different nature and by no means of equal magnitude you last night laid to my charge         6.837438787988284
 the first mentioned was that regardless of the sentiments of either i had detached mr         9.355384553135004
 bingley from your sisterand the other that i had in defiance of various claims in defiance of honour and humanity ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of mr         5.658587456494818
wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth the acknowledged favourite of my father a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage and who had been brought up to expect its exertion would be a depravity to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks could bear no comparison         4.590958329954795
but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed respecting each circumstance i shall hope to be in future secured when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read         4.421008793424475
if in the explanation of them which is due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours i can only say that i am sorry         5.013493963543078
the necessity must be obeyedand farther apology would be absurd         17.03107524728957
i had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common with others that bingley preferred your eldest sister to any other young woman in the country         5.082545837239111
but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment         4.410315350766859
i had often seen him in love before         17.38941963911481
at that ball while i had the honour of dancing with you i was first made acquainted by sir william lucass accidental information that bingleys attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage         5.231707431176093
 he spoke of it as a certain event of which the time alone could be undecided         7.687352031117163
 from that moment i observed my friends behaviour attentively and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him         6.062164787020381
 your sister i also watched         44.8592132826334
her look and manners were open cheerful and engaging as ever but without any symptom of peculiar regard and i remained convinced from the evenings scrutiny that though she received his attentions with pleasure she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment         4.851434475330283
if you have not been mistaken here i must have been in an error         8.030548067158508
 your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable         18.791125014569012
 but i shall not scruple to assert that the serenity of your sisters countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that however amiable her temper her heart was not likely to be easily touched         4.7422825933463635
that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certainbut i will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears         5.276768489754366
i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished iti believed it on impartial conviction as truly as i wished it in reason         5.506330733145026
my objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me         5.014014506570901
but there were other causes of repugnancecauses which though still existing and existing to an equal degree in both instances i had myself endeavoured to forget because they were not immediately before me         5.479129211837329
these causes must be stated though briefly         53.95749709867894
pardon me         1304.811000235673
it pains me to offend you         42.851279589783935
 but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations and your displeasure at this representation of them let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both         4.728906329657562
i will only say farther that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed and every inducement heightened which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection         5.214450773512305
he left netherfield for london on the day following as you i am certain remember with the design of soon returning         6.869088913331214
his sisters uneasiness had been equally excited with my own our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered and alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london         5.813037684785973
we accordingly wentand there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice         10.285982052120783
i described and enforced them earnestly         29.91744153797923
but however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage had it not been seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving of your sisters indifference         4.995007710685259
 he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere if not with equal regard         7.753635260935651
but bingley has great natural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own         8.56002260609494
 to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire when that conviction had been given was scarcely the work of a moment         6.690779222793627
i cannot blame myself for having done thus much         22.0809782673534
 there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sisters being in town         4.232018116988613
 i knew it myself as it was known to miss bingley but her brother is even yet ignorant of it         6.9089937493996265
that they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probablebut his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger         5.926378117689759
it is done however and it was done for the best         11.992235695135866
on this subject i have nothing more to say no other apology to offer         8.513176389123245
with respect to that other more weighty accusation of having injured mr         10.478894093044918
 wickham i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family         6.482283420466682
 my father supported him at school and afterwards at cambridgemost important assistance as his own father always poor from the extravagance of his wife would have been unable to give him a gentlemans education         6.565292061953507
 my father was not only fond of this young mans society whose manners were always engaging he had also the highest opinion of him and hoping the church would be his profession intended to provide for him in it         5.0859657227870585
 as for myself it is many many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner         6.606822715917111
 darcy could not have         75.18663461065628
 but whatever may be the sentiments which mr         19.728159044463876
 wickham has created a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character         10.951376479104784
 it adds even another motive         104.47874930321605
 wickham was to the last so steady that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow and if he took orders desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant         4.503075195798989
 there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds         12.608128466766278
 wickham wrote to inform me that having finally resolved against taking orders he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage in lieu of the preferment by which he could not be benefited         4.997879831354057
 he had some intention he added of studying the law and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein         5.0823004087414505
 i rather wished than believed him to be sincere but at any rate was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal         7.025272437389415
 i knew that mr         70.47838344104153
 wickham ought not to be a clergyman         18.541300809118695
 the business was therefore soon settled         23.39645900899554
 he resigned all claim to assistance in the church were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it and accepted in return three thousand pounds         6.13568604426903
 in town i believe he chiefly lived but his studying the law was a mere pretence and being now free from all restraint his life was a life of idleness and dissipation         5.607026015473501
 for about three years i heard little of him but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him he applied to me again by letter for the presentation         5.64275038843842
 his circumstances he assured me and i had no difficulty in believing it were exceedingly bad         6.808095004619764
 he had found the law a most unprofitable study and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained if i would present him to the living in questionof which he trusted there could be little doubt as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for and i could not have forgotten my revered fathers intentions         4.57367507444212
 his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstancesand he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself         5.828814102089261
 after this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropt         23.753897386912346
 how he lived i know not         49.3871694356518
 but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice         14.373033941036855
 having said thus much i feel no doubt of your secrecy         16.085389716225396
 about a year ago she was taken from school and an establishment formed for her in london and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it to ramsgate and thither also went mr         5.833374756653952
 younge in whose character we were most unhappily deceived and by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to georgiana whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement         5.2656963737564775
 she was then but fifteen which must be her excuse and after stating her imprudence i am happy to add that i owed the knowledge of it to herself         5.574911231911961
 i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement and then georgiana unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father acknowledged the whole to me         5.020752402799113
 you may imagine what i felt and how i acted         16.870800963074593
 wickham who left the place immediately and mrs         25.03951611364141
 wickhams chief object was unquestionably my sisters fortune which is thirty thousand pounds but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement         7.566320373775679
 his revenge would have been complete indeed         36.41968356614311
 this madam is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together and if you do not absolutely reject it as false you will i hope acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mr         4.905414281051291
 i know not in what manner under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at         6.074857989755371
 ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either detection could not be in your power and suspicion certainly not in your inclination         6.320172498896897
 you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night         11.501728351854867
 but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed         5.989665772537772
 if your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin and that there may be the possibility of consulting him i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning         4.586480763364069
 i will only add god bless you         21.364233285684904
 fitzwilliam darcy         1156.644974379049
 if elizabeth when mr         95.8150375436982
 darcy gave her the letter did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers she had formed no expectation at all of its contents         5.4749124308858725
 her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined         11.683495209615785
 with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give which a just sense of shame would not conceal         5.5150025519783155
 with a strong prejudice against every thing he might say she began his account of what had happened at netherfield         6.737314017688563
 she read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes         5.105575442049534
 his belief of her sisters insensibility she instantly resolved to be false and his account of the real the worst objections to the match made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice         5.317147674279081
 he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her his style was not penitent but haughty         7.19519868164708
 it was all pride and insolence         19.71060998397112
 but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr         9.830466250895821
 wickham when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which if true must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition         4.9533121340206625
 astonishment apprehension and even horror oppressed her         34.383060779903026
 in this perturbed state of mind with thoughts that could rest on nothing she walked on but it would not do in half a minute the letter was unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she could she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence         4.142851215821262
 the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself and the kindness of the late mr         4.536532415673994
 darcy though she had not before known its extent agreed equally well with his own words         8.09408280642124
 so far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to the will the difference was great         8.425797798576868
 what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory and as she recalled his very words it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other and for a few moments she flattered herself that her wishes did not err         4.1085848436459855
 but when she read and reread with the closest attention the particulars immediately following of wickhams resigning all pretensions to the living of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds again was she forced to hesitate         4.939343594601775
 she put down the letter weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartialitydeliberated on the probability of each statementbut with little success         6.711798768083733
 on both sides it was only assertion         63.63952682276887
 again she read on         130.5368567052662
 but every line proved more clearly that the affair which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render mr         7.107421827357788
 darcys conduct in it less than infamous was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole         7.886540434119694
 the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to mr         9.393408215326046
 wickhams charge exceedingly shocked her the more so as she could bring no proof of its injustice         12.639748429441754
 she had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire militia in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who on meeting him accidentally in town had there renewed a slight acquaintance         4.996321071038452
 of his former way of life nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself         7.861733759240567
 as to his real character had information been in her power she had never felt a wish of enquiring         5.077359286060209
 his countenance voice and manner had established him at once in the possession of every virtue         10.373723115373904
 darcy or at least by the predominance of virtue atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what mr         6.33203310826577
 but no such recollection befriended her         27.29604885630368
 after pausing on this point a considerable while she once more continued to read         12.836945850860872
 but alas         3816.102399637426
 the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himselffrom whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousins affairs and whose character she had no reason to question         4.3102911787738645
 at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr         5.7397251759935335
 darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal if he had not been well assured of his cousins corroboration         5.491091100071953
 she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself in their first evening at mr         8.92337612382592
 philipss         20990.2
 many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory         9.23451191437652
 she was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger and wondered it had escaped her before         6.509444914311926
 she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct         6.295999641523664
 she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing mr         8.588495260325493
 darcythat mr         2507.183213581947
 darcy might leave the country but that he should stand his ground yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week         7.443712417218956
 she remembered also that till the netherfield family had quitted the country he had told his story to no one but herself but that after their removal it had been every where discussed that he had then no reserves no scruples in sinking mr         5.696851252215482
 darcys character though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son         9.057837862599852
 how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned         15.646133686698477
 his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn         5.134695225875009
 every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter and in farther justification of mr         18.021501168371717
 darcy she could not but allow that mr         13.140461944555945
 bingley when questioned by jane had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair that proud and repulsive as were his manners she had never in the whole course of their acquaintance an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjustany thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits         4.548794012196995
 that had his actions been what wickham represented them so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world and that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man as mr         4.872761105356529
 bingley was incomprehensible         1004.6903177784018
 she grew absolutely ashamed of herself         68.16765478220711
of neither darcy nor wickham could she think without feeling that she had been blind partial prejudiced absurd         6.7231698783779965
 how despicably have i acted         152.95191041099787
 she cried         274.0995303024213
i who have prided myself on my discernment         15.418794295149926
i who have valued myself on my abilities         15.417878882953785
 who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable distrust         8.10694594389259
how humiliating is this discovery         114.62801092591698
yet how just a humiliation         90.6765000549597
had i been in love i could not have been more wretchedly blind         6.455726006819327
 but vanity not love has been my folly         20.855523321537014
 till this moment i never knew myself         38.07993657660384
 darcys explanation there had appeared very insufficient and she read it again         16.913294080921172
 widely different was the effect of a second perusal         26.882596307197126
he declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sisters attachmentand she could not help remembering what charlottes opinion had always been         6.274891166557337
neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane         12.520052018616049
 when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned in terms of such mortifying yet merited reproach her sense of shame was severe         5.414820918256181
 the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as having passed at the netherfield ball and as confirming all his first disapprobation could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers         4.7080990518666
 it soothed but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus selfattracted by the rest of her familyand as she considered that janes disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before         4.148588834263851
 after wandering along the lane for two hours giving way to every variety of thought reconsidering events determining probabilities and reconciling herself as well as she could to a change so sudden and so important fatigue and a recollection of her long absence made her at length return home and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation         4.58047478503825
 she was immediately told that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence mr         7.7032468699421655
 darcy only for a few minutes to take leave but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour hoping for her return and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found         4.692890569152039
elizabeth could but just affect concern in missing him she really rejoiced at it         8.839188440723065
 colonel fitzwilliam was no longer an object         41.17286833616433
 she could think only of her letter         21.837437964287894
 chapter xiv         14675.902278985472
 the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning and mr         12.653943875118953
 collins having been in waiting near the lodges to make them his parting obeisance was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very good health and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings         5.050688294718526
 to rosings he then hastened to console lady catherine and her daughter and on his return brought back with great satisfaction a message from her ladyship importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her         4.076254289040834
 elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting that had she chosen it she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece nor could she think without a smile of what her ladyships indignation would have been         4.7217104428843895
 what would she have said         34.530250931539705
how would she have behaved         38.887357594716086
 were questions with which she amused herself         26.669636162582268
 their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party         17.21703015087824
i assure you i feel it exceedingly said lady catherine i believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as i do         5.639492626669467
they were excessively sorry to go         47.435217357585714
 but so they always are         34.772915004916825
 the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely more i think than last year         6.649420184985301
 his attachment to rosings certainly increases         26.159349963911456
 collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter         6.4517542387275375
 lady catherine observed after dinner that miss bennet seemed out of spirits and immediately accounting for it herself by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon she added but if that is the case you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer         5.0687921106624065
 collins will be very glad of your company i am sure         10.727005336429777
 i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation replied elizabeth but it is not in my power to accept it         4.824097639685423
i must be in town next saturday         18.170725326090228
 why at that rate you will have been here only six weeks         10.673490711509418
 i expected you to stay two months         17.09453643835373
 i told mrs         297.7440504460089
 collins so before you came         52.095840659721915
 there can be no occasion for your going so soon         12.190591365503465
 bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight         24.231003013875753
 but my father cannot         99.35922167264766
he wrote last week to hurry my return         24.908936630330565
 your father of course may spare you if your mother can         11.412846321054781
 and if you will stay another month complete it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london for i am going there early in june for a week and as dawson does not object to the barouche box there will be very good room for one of youand indeed if the weather should happen to be cool i should not object to taking you both as you are neither of you large         3.679934592221371
 you are all kindness madam but i believe we must abide by our original plan         8.335201277181092
 lady catherine seemed resigned         325.95935581420827
 collins you must send a servant with them         18.962756676885967
 it is highly improper         109.0354019469877
 you must contrive to send somebody         58.442999251927404
 i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing         7.6552746081189404
young women should always be properly guarded and attended according to their situation in life         11.544797115389683
 when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer i made a point of her having two men servants go with her         7.642143554586661
miss darcy the daughter of mr         27.278497230495027
 darcy of pemberley and lady anne could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner         7.561608420243189
i am excessively attentive to all those things         29.994180958606385
 you must send john with the young ladies mrs         16.58519045607004
 collins         760.5144927536231
 i am glad it occurred to me to mention it for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone         7.575099262487554
 my uncle is to send a servant for us         17.877186564501166
your uncle         756.8156504306429
he keeps a manservant does he         38.473710806298456
i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things         8.190126849706314
 where shall you change horses         67.00470012628101
oh         4997.666666666667
if you mention my name at the bell you will be attended to         11.74970561717761
 reflection must be reserved for solitary hours whenever she was alone she gave way to it as the greatest relief and not a day went by without a solitary walk in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections         5.532005262177213
 darcys letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart         11.596001850322887
 she studied every sentence and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different         11.101080247742932
 when she remembered the style of his address she was still full of indignation but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him her anger was turned against herself and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion         5.615228089343549
 his attachment excited gratitude his general character respect but she could not approve him nor could she for a moment repent her refusal or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again         5.598968364038626
 in her own past behaviour there was a constant source of vexation and regret and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin         5.040039042960676
 they were hopeless of remedy         80.94775136628378
 her father contented with laughing at them would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters and her mother with manners so far from right herself was entirely insensible of the evil         6.099794728529476
 elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia but while they were supported by their mothers indulgence what chance could there be of improvement         5.592673025680932
 catherine weakspirited irritable and completely under lydias guidance had been always affronted by their advice and lydia selfwilled and careless would scarcely give them a hearing         9.922116525339307
 they were ignorant idle and vain         44.632814857585934
 while there was an officer in meryton they would flirt with him and while meryton was within a walk of longbourn they would be going there for ever         6.07505852610421
 anxiety on janes behalf was another prevailing concern and mr         20.43922034413328
 darcys explanation by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion heightened the sense of what jane had lost         8.62629099969896
 his affection was proved to have been sincere and his conduct cleared of all blame unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend         5.781348927851803
 how grievous then was the thought that of a situation so desirable in every respect so replete with advantage so promising for happiness jane had been deprived by the folly and indecorum of her own family         6.00279996335415
 their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they had been at first         6.255906441953091
 the very last evening was spent there and her ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey gave them directions as to the best method of packing and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way that maria thought herself obliged on her return to undo all the work of the morning and pack her trunk afresh         4.335284537829371
 when they parted lady catherine with great condescension wished them a good journey and invited them to come to hunsford again next year and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both         4.929094947443741
 on saturday morning elizabeth and mr         57.28786501062106
 collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary         6.535198555448153
 i know not miss elizabeth said he whether mrs         14.492507136274726
 collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it         5.833128373380077
 the favour of your company has been much felt i assure you         9.363259010050587
 we know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode         11.16893997052247
 our plain manner of living our small rooms and few domestics and the little we see of the world must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly         4.348419551969861
 elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness         15.322660112997815
 she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment and the pleasure of being with charlotte and the kind attentions she had received must make her feel the obliged         5.408006511576373
 collins was gratified and with a more smiling solemnity replied it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably         6.828309389843895
 we have certainly done our best and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society and from our connection with rosings the frequent means of varying the humble home scene i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome         5.006219731008937
 our situation with regard to lady catherines family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast         7.802162085973813
 you see on what a footing we are         17.13216465700117
 you see how continually we are engaged there         20.93781738919253
 in truth i must acknowledge that with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage i should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings         5.1876124961270955
 words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings and he was obliged to walk about the room while elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences         6.429946867285453
 you may in fact carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire my dear cousin         7.473894456135277
 i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so         11.724677591143873
 lady catherines great attentions to mrs         89.4190799534852
 collins you have been a daily witness of and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunatebut on this point it will be as well to be silent         5.020737137182167
 only let me assure you my dear miss elizabeth that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage         6.13253313886108
 my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking         11.368103319162628
 there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us         7.95369243565244
 we seem to have been designed for each other         17.03728609460906
 elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts         5.65769452000122
 she was not sorry however to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung         4.470598890975317
 poor charlotte         1742.9319098484673
it was melancholy to leave her to such society         18.51160281585886
but she had chosen it with her eyes open and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go she did not seem to ask for compassion         5.543296554184704
 her home and her housekeeping her parish and her poultry and all their dependent concerns had not yet lost their charms         6.18813297679719
 after an affectionate parting between the friends elizabeth was attended to the carriage by mr         11.09743370284931
 collins and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter and his compliments to mr         4.87340049719174
 gardiner though unknown         1365.980183794569
 he then handed her in maria followed and the door was on the point of being closed when he suddenly reminded them with some consternation that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings         4.944876906408383
 but he added you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here         5.832906036487577
 elizabeth made no objectionthe door was then allowed to be shut and the carriage drove off         8.730172017199706
 cried maria after a few minutes silence it seems but a day or two since we first came         7.426603218129101
 a great many indeed said her companion with a sigh         14.645897078744861
 we have dined nine times at rosings besides drinking tea there twice         15.498387175706226
how much i shall have to tell         11.220636888489969
 elizabeth privately added and how much i shall have to conceal         12.773596142922504
 gardiners house where they were to remain a few days         22.331800560610905
 jane looked well and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them         6.446560787659389
 but jane was to go home with her and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation         7.105436464208259
 it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for longbourn before she told her sister of mr         6.111330775004335
 darcys proposals         3729.67821654039
 to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane and must at the same time so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate and her fear if she once entered on the subject of being hurried into repeating something of bingley which might only grieve her sister farther         3.92970329877978
 it was the second week in may in which the three young ladies set out together from gracechurchstreet for the town of in hertfordshire and as they drew near the appointed inn where mr         4.218004948026272
 bennets carriage was to meet them they quickly perceived in token of the coachmans punctuality both kitty and lydia looking out of a diningroom up stairs         6.9139151433778245
 after welcoming their sisters they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords exclaiming is not this nice         8.1036050839183
 is not this an agreeable surprise         26.312527186405003
 and we mean to treat you all added lydia but you must lend us the money for we have just spent ours at the shop out there         6.358018241014787
 then shewing her purchases look here i have bought this bonnet         15.507732034622475
 i do not think it is very pretty but i thought i might as well buy it as not         5.108137984715235
 and when her sisters abused it as ugly she added with perfect unconcern oh         7.300551696583357
 but there were two or three much uglier in the shop and when i have bought some prettiercoloured satin to trim it with fresh i think it will be very tolerable         5.5941993953087135
 besides it will not much signify what one wears this summer after the shire have left meryton and they are going in a fortnight         7.116438358498825
 are they indeed         339.349508515579
 cried elizabeth with the greatest satisfaction         25.299493670596583
 they are going to be encamped near brighton and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer         7.3371408973965
 it would be such a delicious scheme and i dare say would hardly cost any thing at all         5.899054610446869
 mamma would like to go too of all things         26.1190240707916
 only think what a miserable summer else we shall have         15.815732954169386
 yes thought elizabeth that would be a delightful scheme indeed and completely do for us at once         8.682237291525363
 good heaven         2676.4117524601447
 brighton and a whole campful of soldiers to us who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia and the monthly balls of meryton         5.868751930265277
 now i have got some news for you said lydia as they sat down to table         7.147836583793357
 what do you think         39.28311424053148
 it is excellent news capital news and about a certain person that we all like         9.82685361119026
 jane and elizabeth looked at each other and the waiter was told that he need not stay         6.534537535848909
 you thought the waiter must not hear as if he cared         9.966073230292618
 i dare say he often hears worse things said than i am going to say         8.694222307845324
 but he is an ugly fellow         22.515553302977207
 i am glad he is gone         41.724277506798394
 i never saw such a long chin in my life         10.102924717139867
 well but now for my news it is about dear wickham too good for the waiter is not it         7.530609876461823
 theres for you         733.2055701024925
 she is gone down to her uncle at liverpool gone to stay         10.952438843699682
 wickham is safe         835.3671813241817
 and mary king is safe         101.84348101691155
 added elizabeth safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune         21.489591923847634
 she is a great fool for going away if she liked him         7.0499709809709
 but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side said jane         7.784795239850363
 i am sure there is not on his         22.697584129242596
 i will answer for it he never cared three straws about her         11.971947473917563
 who could about such a nasty little freckled thing         18.05779886558689
 elizabeth was shocked to think that however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal         6.015415623121362
 as soon as all had ate and the elder ones paid the carriage was ordered and after some contrivance the whole party with all their boxes workbags and parcels and the unwelcome addition of kittys and lydias purchases were seated in it         4.981241451453833
 how nicely we are crammed in         96.41318238938962
 i am glad i bought my bonnet if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox         9.307135936560552
 well now let us be quite comfortable and snug and talk and laugh all the way home         8.1235837912083
 and in the first place let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away         4.249315440995409
 have you seen any pleasant men         31.731355575255478
 have you had any flirting         29.036964464615533
 i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back         6.115088469904727
 jane will be quite an old maid soon i declare         13.542976474366322
 she is almost three and twenty         29.533730578209614
 lord how ashamed i should be of not being married before three and twenty         15.046591217335948
 my aunt philips wants you so to get husbands you cant think         16.970451940994735
 she says lizzy had better have taken mr         26.32589102837284
 collins but i do not think there would have been any fun in it         5.825458942145794
 lord         13118.875
 how i should like to be married before any of you and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls         6.2078613777896905
 dear me         423.8201248741072
 we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel forsters         9.280045946474127
 forster promised to have a little dance in the evening by the bye mrs         11.082592254775074
 and so she asked the two harringtons to come but harriet was ill and so pen was forced to come by herself and then what do you think we did         4.600799844462468
 we dressed up chamberlayne in womans clothes on purpose to pass for a ladyonly think what fun         10.499140527227748
 forster and kitty and me except my aunt for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns and you cannot imagine how well he looked         6.620718431375747
 when denny and wickham and pratt and two or three more of the men came in they did not know him in the least         6.021761021845757
 lord         13118.875
 how i laughed         579.5392284065935
 and so did mrs         50.30207758641798
 and that made the men suspect something and then they soon found out what was the matter         6.918099600348307
 with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did lydia assisted by kittys hints and additions endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longbourn         5.747580234224731
 their reception at home was most kind         31.103282056530837
 bennet rejoiced to see jane in undiminished beauty and more than once during dinner did mr         8.14176902126897
 bennet say voluntarily to elizabeth i am glad you are come back lizzy         10.347056834029269
 their party in the diningroom was large for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news and various were the subjects which occupied them lady lucas was enquiring of maria across the table after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter mrs         4.953144078018986
 bennet was doubly engaged on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane who sat some way below her and on the other retailing them all to the younger miss lucases and lydia in a voice rather louder than any other persons was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her         5.057919533644551
 mary said she i wish you had gone with us for we had such fun         8.113259380958747
 as we went along kitty and me drew up all the blinds and pretended there was nobody in the coach and i should have gone so all the way if kitty had not been sick and when we got to the george i do think we behaved very handsomely for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world and if you would have gone we would have treated you too         4.242790343683074
 and then when we came away it was such fun         12.183502398183705
 i thought we never should have got into the coach         14.19804456460696
 i was ready to die of laughter         22.897668660572275
 and then we were so merry all the way home         10.185131611821483
 we talked and laughed so loud that any body might have heard us ten miles off         8.58897418190194
 to this mary very gravely replied far be it from me my dear sister to depreciate such pleasures         6.674416385901291
 they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds         18.25023131286728
 but i confess they would have no charms for me         16.107853347410703
 i should infinitely prefer a book         56.41684387428405
 she seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute and never attended to mary at all         8.277720651253015
 in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton and see how every body went on but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme         5.310995876241976
 it should not be said that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers         5.6988541941078665
 she dreaded seeing wickham again and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible         11.535184057651389
 in a fortnight they were to go and once gone she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account         6.123462067439973
 she had not been many hours at home before she found that the brighton scheme of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn was under frequent discussion between her parents         5.2330821268401575
 elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal that her mother though often disheartened had never yet despaired of succeeding at last         5.015609425496133
 chapter xvii         14675.902278985472
 elizabeths impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned and preparing her to be surprised she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr         4.809659142271479
 darcy and herself         133.81128885316022
 miss bennets astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings         7.412628910393634
 she was sorry that mr         48.49943812571479
 darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sisters refusal must have given him         5.206844879162932
 his being so sure of succeeding was wrong said she and certainly ought not to have appeared but consider how much it must increase his disappointment         5.561067465604475
 indeed replied elizabeth i am heartily sorry for him but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me         7.286913659140375
 you do not blame me however for refusing him         14.0249759935762
 blame you         708.6877506153281
 oh no         952.609609975457
 but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham         11.559064960704474
 noi do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did         13.936792792871039
 but you will know it when i have told you what happened the very next day         6.941725800228778
 she then spoke of the letter repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham         8.006163234025854
 what a stroke was this for poor jane         30.616187304542667
 who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here collected in one individual         7.180826069004612
 most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error and seek to clear one without involving the other         8.501314664702203
 this will not do said elizabeth         27.470306861705858
 you never will be able to make both of them good for any thing         7.450238897538617
 take your choice but you must be satisfied with only one         18.282790839938173
 there is but such a quantity of merit between them just enough to make one good sort of man and of late it has been shifting about pretty much         5.780294329758985
 darcys but you shall do as you chuse         18.2755870125884
 it was some time however before a smile could be extorted from jane         7.345592929419118
 i do not know when i have been more shocked said she         6.291509847996913
 wickham so very bad         95.19319666193962
 it is almost past belief         47.711678015813284
 dear lizzy only consider what he must have suffered         17.590830877068285
 such a disappointment         419.99080330995287
 and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too         8.51207917141242
 and having to relate such a thing of his sister         9.653919644417723
 it is really too distressing         46.011142816865956
 i am sure you must feel it so         16.094153646850707
 no my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both         9.334151808649878
 i know you will do him such ample justice that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent         6.537494018668437
 your profusion makes me saving and if you lament over him much longer my heart will be as light as a feather         10.41032166065141
 poor wickham there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance         14.230232628783545
 there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men         9.629771346523015
 one has got all the goodness and the other all the appearance of it         9.167108753608815
 i never thought mr         114.14489365939458
 darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do         11.327680154300928
 and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him without any reason         6.68201047821477
 it is such a spur to ones genius such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind         6.579603544821983
 one may be continually abusive without saying any thing just but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty         6.275742601029194
 lizzy when you first read that letter i am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now         6.407861205919176
 i was uncomfortable enough         132.89596694348677
 how i wanted you         135.84093790314262
 darcy for now they do appear wholly undeserved         17.5837024531629
 but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging         7.74189279927863
 there is one point on which i want your advice         13.954431644473829
 i want to be told whether i ought or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand wickhams character         6.716347479680931
 what is your own opinion         41.93654579857802
 that it ought not to be attempted         16.66423317480639
 darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public         13.441060935995427
 on the contrary every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct who will believe me         5.093734895070216
 the general prejudice against mr         86.44315822950745
 darcy is so violent that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light         4.871316228840965
 i am not equal to it         30.115897093488062
 wickham will soon be gone and therefore it will not signify to anybody here what he really is         7.679548055477972
 sometime hence it will be all found out and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before         10.475464898138283
 at present i will say nothing about it         18.49838641884787
 you are quite right         103.84197085428056
 to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever         9.18337705936385
 he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done and anxious to reestablish a character         5.889782057917528
 we must not make him desperate         32.97997863490984
 the tumult of elizabeths mind was allayed by this conversation         13.723707096732802
 she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight and was certain of a willing listener in jane whenever she might wish to talk again of either         5.311030641911836
 but there was still something lurking behind of which prudence forbad the disclosure         7.681533094757787
 she dared not relate the other half of mr         17.826145075507647
 darcys letter nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend         9.988046420555978
 and then said she if that very improbable event should ever take place i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself         5.6065715243108425
 the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value         9.821246380911143
 she was now on being settled at home at leisure to observe the real state of her sisters spirits         6.782183787947816
 jane was not happy         60.27698000046946
 she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley         25.447228593738192
 bennet one day what is your opinion now of this sad business of janes         10.731350305750844
 for my part i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody         8.505900330132643
 i told my sister philips so the other day         14.87495860743116
 but i cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london         6.4432018409396825
 well he is a very undeserving young manand i do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now         4.904629256486129
 there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer and i have enquired of every body too who is likely to know         5.424006713958743
 i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more         7.441988380151997
 oh well         1473.24653930629
 it is just as he chooses         30.79408593151223
 nobody wants him to come         122.87298479832782
 well my comfort is i am sure jane will die of a broken heart and then he will be sorry for what he has done         5.123582740836875
 well lizzy continued her mother soon afterwards and so the collinses live very comfortable do they         10.496560596066917
 well well i only hope it will last         18.289792309401044
 and what sort of table do they keep         15.722767993611761
 charlotte is an excellent manager i dare say         21.005606948942706
 there is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping i dare say         14.768910365526116
 no nothing at all         80.78364691390638
 a great deal of good management depend upon it         12.397235801811188
 yes yes         2599.330266638579
 they will take care not to outrun their income         18.00105166640623
 they will never be distressed for money         25.459578576512005
 well much good may it do them         28.848912596764315
 they look upon it quite as their own i dare say whenever that happens         11.559141568979449
 no         257.86486486486484
 it would have been strange if they had         10.962661138482675
 but i make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves         10.321826941701907
 well if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own so much the better         6.565264878900422
 chapter xviii         14675.902278985472
 the first week of their return was soon gone         17.72983909774424
 the second began         547.1693623038855
 it was the last of the regiments stay in meryton and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace         4.464852677268929
 the dejection was almost universal         73.85884085010014
 the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat drink and sleep and pursue the usual course of their employments         6.64158442216216
 very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia whose own misery was extreme and who could not comprehend such hardheartedness in any of the family         5.760994169806424
 good heaven         2676.4117524601447
 what is to become of us         8.87122710764858
 what are we to do         55.05447009739934
 would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe         17.067433149693276
 i am sure said she i cried for two days together when colonel millars regiment went away         8.392635798705074
 i thought i should have broke my heart         15.653836810648032
 i am sure i shall break mine said lydia         11.506031025585244
 if one could but go to brighton         10.163167714393017
 observed mrs         1224.6205017299583
if one could but go to brighton         10.163167714393017
 but papa is so disagreeable         69.56723895256219
 a little seabathing would set me up for ever         29.194966503644583
 and my aunt philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good added kitty         4.280524353246338
 elizabeth tried to be diverted by them but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame         8.647297344652593
 she felt anew the justice of mr         57.97433092787053
 darcys objections and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend         7.316844495594008
 but the gloom of lydias prospect was shortly cleared away for she received an invitation from mrs         9.134302646945175
 this invaluable friend was a very young woman and very lately married         15.377222631450401
 a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other and out of their three months acquaintance they had been intimate two         5.705799879530354
 the rapture of lydia on this occasion her adoration of mrs         11.868440497102167
 forster the delight of mrs         76.38426504534652
 bennet and the mortification of kitty are scarcely to be described         8.150963654511845
 wholly inattentive to her sisters feelings lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy calling for every ones congratulations and laughing and talking with more violence than ever whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish         5.480594885630443
 i cannot see why mrs         61.364641119778284
 forster should not ask me as well as lydia said she though i am not her particular friend         8.75655812404994
 i have just as much right to be asked as she has and more too for i am two years older         7.104764431290966
 in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable and jane to make her resigned         8.876005487009776
 as for elizabeth herself this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia that she considered it as the deathwarrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter and detestable as such a step must make her were it known she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go         4.250534979180076
 she represented to him all the improprieties of lydias general behaviour the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs         5.748631290057005
 forster and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton where the temptations must be greater than at home         5.478792510058224
 he heard her attentively and then said lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances         4.942961906184011
 already arisen         7954.250271698695
 repeated mr         900.4586951771373
 what has she frightened away some of your lovers         14.349492467439076
 poor little lizzy         1047.762092831261
 but do not be cast down         28.13835632132912
 such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret         15.241241229182426
 come let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydias folly         8.894394320541375
 i have no such injuries to resent         19.353180473790744
 it is not of peculiar but of general evils which i am now complaining         7.166801720028894
 our importance our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild volatility the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydias character         7.7914575363204595
 a flirt too in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite         5.319047102114409
 in this danger kitty is also comprehended         28.20575220279341
 she will follow wherever lydia leads         46.85844150871868
 vain ignorant idle and absolutely uncontrouled         137.8364186428606
 my dear father can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace         6.197927326130514
 bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject and affectionately taking her hand said in reply do not make yourself uneasy my love         5.186334306015433
 wherever you and jane are known you must be respected and valued and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple ofor i may say three very silly sisters         5.784759448708041
 let her go then         139.8023018075875
 colonel forster is a sensible man and will keep her out of any real mischief and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body         6.3958709272131395
 at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here         8.259090521549611
 the officers will find women better worth their notice         16.259015462860777
 let us hope therefore that her being there may teach her her own insignificance         12.643722900039533
 at any rate she cannot grow many degrees worse without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life         6.345683939179432
 it was not in her nature however to increase her vexations by dwelling on them         4.703765039577687
 she was confident of having performed her duty and to fret over unavoidable evils or augment them by anxiety was no part of her disposition         7.02389640665744
 had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility         5.088630727299422
 in lydias imagination a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness         14.68896378808553
 she saw with the creative eye of fancy the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers         7.281050215134882
 she saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at present unknown         8.112524106713765
 had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these what would have been her sensations         6.381745223682508
 they could have been understood only by her mother who might have felt nearly the same         8.162106543670777
 lydias going to brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husbands never intending to go there himself         7.225994986434471
 but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of lydias leaving home         4.742686083062645
 elizabeth was now to see mr         26.186231014922353
 wickham for the last time         28.431778378964044
 having been frequently in company with him since her return agitation was pretty well over the agitations of former partiality entirely so         7.318830364688732
 in his present behaviour to herself moreover she had a fresh source of displeasure for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve after what had since passed to provoke her         4.882914253676705
 she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry and while she steadily repressed it could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing that however long and for whatever cause his attentions had been withdrawn her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal         4.726029210846641
 on the very last day of the regiments remaining in meryton he dined with others of the officers at longbourn and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford she mentioned colonel fitzwilliams and mr         4.29265678983771
 darcys having both spent three weeks at rosings and asked him if he were acquainted with the former         10.054748979168853
 he looked surprised displeased alarmed but with a moments recollection and a returning smile replied that he had formerly seen him often and after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man asked her how she had liked him         4.9812508559579465
 her answer was warmly in his favour         19.744989052552004
 nearly three weeks         3696.1560042925134
 and you saw him frequently         35.19622242209832
 yes almost every day         189.70546676047357
 his manners are very different from his cousins         21.11983214950008
 yes very different         916.0336725433165
 but i think mr         70.68279988977773
 darcy improves on acquaintance         227.2316146353618
 indeed         1295.6913580246912
 cried wickham with a look which did not escape her         15.622736915865266
 and pray may i ask         66.24927652140167
 but checking himself he added in a gayer tone is it in address that he improves         12.220520366447989
 has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style         15.659017618203864
 for i dare not hope he continued in a lower and more serious tone that he is improved in essentials         6.894850961716979
 oh no         952.609609975457
 said elizabeth         319.0614551513965
 in essentials i believe he is very much what he ever was         12.261102187516721
 while she spoke wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning         8.137804974513603
 there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention while she added when i said that he improved on acquaintance i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement but that from knowing him better his disposition was better understood         4.396095440141377
 wickhams alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look for a few minutes he was silent till shaking off his embarrassment he turned to her again and said in the gentlest of accents you who so well know my feelings towards mr         5.417969175949928
 darcy will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right         7.551397276162342
 his pride in that direction may be of service if not to himself to many others for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by         5.597119887928882
 i only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you i imagine have been alluding is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe         5.643044662490746
 his fear of her has always operated i know when they were together and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh which i am certain he has very much at heart         4.503720052508833
 elizabeth could not repress a smile at this but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head         5.555901564005197
 she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances and she was in no humour to indulge him         4.855722075533199
 the rest of the evening passed with the appearance on his side of usual cheerfulness but with no farther attempt to distinguish elizabeth and they parted at last with mutual civility and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again         4.387562360076514
 when the party broke up lydia returned with mrs         17.20891325019267
 forster to meryton from whence they were to set out early the next morning         10.88030846820845
 the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic         13.499431246481107
 kitty was the only one who shed tears but she did weep from vexation and envy         6.815987984991699
 chapter xix         14675.902278985472
 had elizabeths opinion been all drawn from her own family she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort         6.499170395175179
 her father captivated by youth and beauty and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally give had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her         5.566903253153583
 respect esteem and confidence had vanished for ever and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown         9.60045752856663
 he was fond of the country and of books and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments         6.9794966550994655
 to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement         6.9526712781742805
 this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife but where other powers of entertainment are wanting the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given         5.1653716707582635
 elizabeth however had never been blind to the impropriety of her fathers behaviour as a husband         7.208158707999276
 she had always seen it with pain but respecting his abilities and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children was so highly reprehensible         4.6714794085446885
 but she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so illjudged a direction of talents talents which rightly used might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife         4.393340329504285
 when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickhams departure she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment         6.510740319527205
 their parties abroad were less varied than before and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle and though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense since the disturbers of her brain were removed her other sister from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp         4.746172467879672
 it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation console herself for the present and prepare for another disappointment         4.973687120036051
 but it is fortunate thought she that i have something to wish for         8.542008316330648
 were the whole arrangement complete my disappointment would be certain         13.085195218561047
 but here by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sisters absence i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized         6.02607766846807
 a scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation         5.913195334239042
 when lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and kitty but her letters were always long expected and always very short         6.107059204090397
 those to her mother contained little else than that they were just returned from the library where such and such officers had attended them and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild that she had a new gown or a new parasol which she would have described more fully but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry as mrs         4.329848147858587
 forster called her and they were going to the campand from her correspondence with her sister there was still less to be learntfor her letters to kitty though rather longer were much too full of lines under the words to be made public         5.187469590271177
 after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence health good humour and cheerfulness began to reappear at longbourn         7.167763163334143
 everything wore a happier aspect         272.62214071877105
 the families who had been in town for the winter came back again and summer finery and summer engagements arose         6.453377903593167
 bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity and by the middle of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope that by the following christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the waroffice another regiment should be quartered in meryton         4.313558804399799
 the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching and a fortnight only was wanting of it when a letter arrived from mrs         5.589531887533013
 gardiner which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent         11.956968150748317
 gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july and must be in london again within a month and as that left too short a period for them to go so far and see so much as they had proposed or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on they were obliged to give up the lakes and substitute a more contracted tour and according to the present plan were to go no farther northward than derbyshire         4.450609457989178
 gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction         21.256330885601745
 the town where she had formerly passed some years of her life and where they were now to spend a few days was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of matlock chatsworth dovedale or the peak         5.250514233456754
 elizabeth was excessively disappointed she had set her heart on seeing the lakes and still thought there might have been time enough         7.374489430379667
 but it was her business to be satisfiedand certainly her temper to be happy and all was soon right again         6.13887853402486
 with the mention of derbyshire there were many ideas connected         13.512652378090785
 it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner         6.721335896350911
 but surely said she i may enter his county with impunity and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me         7.530916449989382
 the period of expectation was now doubled         19.370287431136255
 four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunts arrival         14.18743262853757
 but they did pass away and mr         21.449534706621463
 gardiner with their four children did at length appear at longbourn         12.294528459941374
 the children two girls of six and eight years old and two younger boys were to be left under the particular care of their cousin jane who was the general favourite and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every wayteaching them playing with them and loving them         4.853055965986361
 the gardiners staid only one night at longbourn and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement         8.483858748987384
 one enjoyment was certainthat of suitableness as companions a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniencescheerfulness to enhance every pleasureand affection and intelligence which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad         5.7184117353672335
 it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay oxford blenheim warwick kenelworth birmingham c         5.268385407352513
 a small part of derbyshire is all the present concern         17.23164922560618
 to the little town of lambton the scene of mrs         9.58617278826741
 gardiners former residence and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained they bent their steps after having seen all the principal wonders of the country and within five miles of lambton elizabeth found from her aunt that pemberley was situated         5.901774967737768
 it was not in their direct road nor more than a mile or two out of it         5.790458282656601
 gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again         17.425615931780165
 gardiner declared his willingness and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation         13.553321567538537
 said her aunt         348.29849547699735
 a place too with which so many of your acquaintance are connected         11.770245698010942
 elizabeth was distressed         397.17288526396686
 she felt that she had no business at pemberley and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it         6.360286108591932
 she must own that she was tired of great houses after going over so many she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains         6.336286374297223
 gardiner abused her stupidity         257.2958742693706
 if it were merely a fine house richly furnished said she i should not care about it myself but the grounds are delightful         5.993616828228628
 they have some of the finest woods in the country         13.224633258061225
 elizabeth said no morebut her mind could not acquiesce         14.349381142212687
 the possibility of meeting mr         41.20341551900942
 darcy while viewing the place instantly occurred         51.009295817824
 it would be dreadful         56.88238302013034
 she blushed at the very idea and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk         5.078274356962232
 but against this there were objections and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered         5.23998526186958
 a most welcome negative followed the last questionand her alarms being now removed she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself and when the subject was revived the next morning and she was again applied to could readily answer and with a proper air of indifference that she had not really any dislike to the scheme         4.0732924725303095
 to pemberley therefore they were to go         19.818979415811608

 the park was very large and contained great variety of ground         11.045917474820534
 they entered it in one of its lowest points and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent         6.41094828385025
 elizabeths mind was too full for conversation but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view         8.628854595746258
 they gradually ascended for half a mile and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence where the wood ceased and the eye was instantly caught by pemberley house situated on the opposite side of a valley into which the road with some abruptness wound         5.436495000247905
 its banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned         40.65565005939679
 elizabeth was delighted         333.7111792972647
 she had never seen a place for which nature had done more or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste         5.471370377542861
 they were all of them warm in their admiration and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of pemberley might be something         5.744569835994074
 they descended the hill crossed the bridge and drove to the door and while examining the nearer aspect of the house all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned         5.773575958150095
 she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken         31.877061027120906
 on applying to see the place they were admitted into the hall and elizabeth as they waited for the housekeeper had leisure to wonder at her being where she was         5.756524035820392
 they followed her into the diningparlour         30.79190108687134
 it was a large wellproportioned room handsomely fitted up         10.462326307768565
 the hill crowned with wood from which they had descended receiving increased abruptness from the distance was a beautiful object         10.354235850629406
 every disposition of the ground was good and she looked on the whole scene the river the trees scattered on its banks and the winding of the valley as far as she could trace it with delight         5.35028687886261
 as they passed into other rooms these objects were taking different positions but from every window there were beauties to be seen         7.169260996581567
 the rooms were lofty and handsome and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor but elizabeth saw with admiration of his taste that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine with less of splendor and more real elegance than the furniture of rosings         5.068886241571155
 and of this place thought she i might have been mistress         8.260964519218069
 instead of viewing them as a stranger i might have rejoiced in them as my own and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt         6.806779258112616
but norecollecting herselfthat could never be my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me i should not have been allowed to invite them         7.654332785047206
 this was a lucky recollectionit saved her from something like regret         8.067687289303784
 she longed to enquire of the housekeeper whether her master were really absent but had not courage for it         7.634741346422973
 at length however the question was asked by her uncle and she turned away with alarm while mrs         8.831565035354021
 reynolds replied that he was adding but we expect him tomorrow with a large party of friends         8.648727571230383
 how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day         9.219519886387182
 her aunt now called her to look at a picture         14.811983658207488
 she approached and saw the likeness of mr         17.389719563966626
 her aunt asked her smilingly how she liked it         20.098957234611387
 the housekeeper came forward and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman the son of her late masters steward who had been brought up by him at his own expence         5.502637898728306
he is now gone into the army she added but i am afraid he has turned out very wild         4.68465065836228
 gardiner looked at her niece with a smile but elizabeth could not return it         7.915023204575184
 reynolds pointing to another of the miniatures is my masterand very like him         14.30007716004716
 it was drawn at the same time as the otherabout eight years ago         8.354530056976454
 i have heard much of your masters fine person said mrs         12.74405615293663
 gardiner looking at the picture it is a handsome face         17.07141710604852
 but lizzy you can tell us whether it is like or not         10.648234183321778
 reynoldss respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master         13.622520553561282
 does that young lady know mr         38.42532827003469
 elizabeth coloured and saida little         64.9427281317705
 and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman maam         10.134221106434342
 yes very handsome         863.4304270343106
 i am sure i know none so handsome but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer larger picture of him than this         5.842778401220861
 this room was my late masters favourite room and these miniatures are just as they used to be then         7.386473560294945
 he was very fond of them         16.319307630252652
 this accounted to elizabeth for mr         53.78985019739444
 wickhams being among them         322.33541884527733
 reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy drawn when she was only eight years old         10.872257772721518
 and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother         11.922255490388084
 said mr         242.14380765601004
 yesthe handsomest young lady that ever was seen and so accomplished         30.394050177991083
she plays and sings all day long         32.335406090234926
 in the next room is a new instrument just come down for hera present from my master she comes here tomorrow with him         6.3608805165364695
 gardiner whose manners were easy and pleasant encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks mrs         11.30915192917958
 reynolds either from pride or attachment had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister         9.760856086737586
 not so much as i could wish sir but i dare say he may spend half his time here and miss darcy is always down for the summer months         4.71092995691092
 except thought elizabeth when she goes to ramsgate         29.14587186689972
 if your master would marry you might see more of him         15.178060266449515
 yes sir but i do not know when that will be         7.1632756773375625
 i do not know who is good enough for him         8.14911724954828
 gardiner smiled         2316.283089407777
 elizabeth could not help saying it is very much to his credit i am sure that you should think so         5.445680721532221
 i say no more than the truth and what every body will say that knows him replied the other         6.847868754912095
 elizabeth thought this was going pretty far and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added i have never had a cross word from him in my life and i have known him ever since he was four years old         4.5684642419719
 this was praise of all others most extraordinary most opposite to her ideas         9.545443957223585
 that he was not a goodtempered man had been her firmest opinion         7.499993065594524
 her keenest attention was awakened she longed to hear more and was grateful to her uncle for saying there are very few people of whom so much can be said         6.378662171148904
 you are lucky in having such a master         27.834975668918396
 yes sir i know i am         42.195236172778216
 if i was to go through the world i could not meet with a better         7.765022527881915
 but i have always observed that they who are goodnatured when children are goodnatured when they grow up and he was always the sweetesttempered most generoushearted boy in the world         5.479732230946456
 elizabeth almost stared at her         126.975536516998
can this be mr         85.66675389926733
 thought she         296.78019972863916
 his father was an excellent man said mrs         17.241106651359615
 yes maam that he was indeed and his son will be just like himjust as affable to the poor         8.82830538059743
 reynolds could interest her on no other point         36.38052704010312
 she related the subject of the pictures the dimensions of the rooms and the price of the furniture in vain         6.013982284495675
 gardiner highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master soon led again to the subject and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase         6.087386904106068
 he is the best landlord and the best master said she that ever lived         7.1629717636783745
 not like the wild young men nowadays who think of nothing but themselves         7.634325673921533
 there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name         7.76780347422521
 some people call him proud but i am sure i never saw any thing of it         5.554421626868689
 to my fancy it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men         8.675196993822905
 in what an amiable light does this place him         13.5533447743658
 thought elizabeth         534.0455332300002
 this fine account of him whispered her aunt as they walked is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend         8.174599092628664
 perhaps we might be deceived         77.4823534110504
 that is not very likely our authority was too good         10.929574697914818
 he is certainly a good brother said elizabeth as she walked towards one of the windows         7.719340411421771
 reynolds anticipated miss darcys delight when she should enter the room         23.994604560389178
 and this is always the way with him she added         7.566397650445079
 there is nothing he would not do for her         16.99672899213829
 the picture gallery and two or three of the principal bedrooms were all that remained to be shewn         8.65649872410461
 in the former were many good paintings but elizabeth knew nothing of the art and from such as had been already visible below she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcys in crayons whose subjects were usually more interesting and also more intelligible         4.974821845502488
 in the gallery there were many family portraits but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger         7.778057311077769
 elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her         7.901632678712757
 at last it arrested herand she beheld a striking resemblance of mr         10.302965236074376
 darcy with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her         6.109969845128027
 she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery         8.594183034997194
 reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his fathers life time         11.945600815812902
 there was certainly at this moment in elizabeths mind a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance         5.980504544488547
 the commendation bestowed on him by mrs         41.97547702314662
 reynolds was of no trifling nature         30.015431390543945
 what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant         12.236568227531714
 as a brother a landlord a master she considered how many peoples happiness were in his guardianship         7.932031364007015
how much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow         8.203907537220786
 every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character and as she stood before the canvas on which he was represented and fixed his eyes upon herself she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before she remembered its warmth and softened its impropriety of expression         4.783357868726708
 when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen they returned down stairs and taking leave of the housekeeper were consigned over to the gardener who met them at the hall door         5.043148046123171
 as they walked across the lawn towards the river elizabeth turned back to look again her uncle and aunt stopped also and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables         4.595411858779993
 they were within twenty yards of each other and so abrupt was his appearance that it was impossible to avoid his sight         5.971143268589287
 their eyes instantly met and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush         11.318974562958976
 he absolutely started and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise but shortly recovering himself advanced towards the party and spoke to elizabeth if not in terms of perfect composure at least of perfect civility         6.343086221783022
 she had instinctively turned away but stopping on his approach received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome         8.551908031412117
 had his first appearance or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw mr         5.612753973526536
 darcy the gardeners expression of surprise on beholding his master must immediately have told it         12.146037892694203
 they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece who astonished and confused scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family         5.022739371576399
 amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind the few minutes in which they continued together were some of the most uncomfortable of her life         4.848658321356524
 nor did he seem much more at ease when he spoke his accent had none of its usual sedateness and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn and of her stay in derbyshire so often and in so hurried a way as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts         4.7277033963474535
 at length every idea seemed to fail him and after standing a few moments without saying a word he suddenly recollected himself and took leave         6.545923255732561
 the others then joined her and expressed their admiration of his figure but elizabeth heard not a word and wholly engrossed by her own feelings followed them in silence         5.456565036664199
 she was overpowered by shame and vexation         30.580338729646957
 her coming there was the most unfortunate the most illjudged thing in the world         7.656294283911235
 how strange must it appear to him         39.81285567948625
 in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man         6.413547031312295
 it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again         11.263297369200036
 why did she come         116.47868799272183
 or why did he thus come a day before he was expected         13.508787525229355
 had they been only ten minutes sooner they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination for it was plain that he was that moment arrived that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage         4.837964804277777
 she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting         14.966768503959116
 and his behaviour so strikingly alteredwhat could it mean         13.597945134980325
 that he should even speak to her was amazing         13.4105876110309
but to speak with such civility to enquire after her family         10.846140741283447
 never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting         5.846152228550698
 what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosings park when he put his letter into her hand         8.82607615433482
 they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it and though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out she distinguished no part of the scene         3.763278562065603
 her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house whichever it might be where mr         8.074429186055028
 darcy then was         219.80812841301235
 she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind in what manner he thought of her and whether in defiance of every thing she was still dear to him         5.169952096219621
 perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease yet there had been that in his voice which was not like ease         6.365048537985628
 whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell but he certainly had not seen her with composure         5.95006903570543
 at length however the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself         6.455875786048784
 they entered the woods and bidding adieu to the river for a while ascended some of the higher grounds whence in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander were many charming views of the valley the opposite hills with the long range of woods overspreading many and occasionally part of the stream         4.675165512597827
 gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park but feared it might be beyond a walk         8.592630310328605
 with a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round         14.121131879284233
 it settled the matter and they pursued the accustomed circuit which brought them again after some time in a descent among hanging woods to the edge of the water in one of its narrowest parts         4.976782154126733
 they crossed it by a simple bridge in character with the general air of the scene it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited and the valley here contracted into a glen allowed room only for the stream and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppicewood which bordered it         5.013545277385307
 elizabeth longed to explore its windings but when they had crossed the bridge and perceived their distance from the house mrs         6.462733714694711
 her niece was therefore obliged to submit and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river in the nearest direction but their progress was slow for mr         4.833685766403009
 gardiner though seldom able to indulge the taste was very fond of fishing and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water and talking to the man about them that he advanced but little         5.19631427878667
 whilst wandering on in this slow manner they were again surprised and elizabeths astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of mr         6.711765917609023
 darcy approaching them and at no great distance         26.121637140460848
 the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side allowed them to see him before they met         6.918433830132642
 elizabeth however astonished was at least more prepared for an interview than before and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness if he really intended to meet them         6.6355851997171955
 for a few moments indeed she felt that he would probably strike into some other path         7.272790034040094
 this idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view the turning past he was immediately before them         8.97283736579009
 her colour changed and she said no more         32.25216290319317
 gardiner was standing a little behind and on her pausing he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends         5.5130436296910625
 this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself         4.78668261217482
 what will be his surprise thought she when he knows who they are         9.736310004305079
 he takes them now for people of fashion         23.714151535672876
 the introduction however was immediately made and as she named their relationship to herself she stole a sly look at him to see how he bore it and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions         5.012880166845577
 that he was surprised by the connexion was evident he sustained it however with fortitude and so far from going away turned back with them and entered into conversation with mr         4.743461561912557
 elizabeth could not but be pleased could not but triumph         8.514447893639186
 it was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush         8.678483410289962
 the conversation soon turned upon fishing and she heard mr         12.977880941920565
 darcy invite him with the greatest civility to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport         4.980444643087582
 gardiner who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth gave her a look expressive of her wonder         8.222153796973894
 elizabeth said nothing but it gratified her exceedingly the compliment must be all for herself         8.92060543335182
 her astonishment however was extreme and continually was she repeating why is he so altered         9.539891558859997
 from what can it proceed         54.08183511905962
 it cannot be for me it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened         6.726947532036498
 my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this         15.892810776950606
 it is impossible that he should still love me         14.608011098694181
 after walking some time in this way the two ladies in front the two gentlemen behind on resuming their places after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious waterplant there chanced to be a little alteration         5.546821276151449
 it originated in mrs         132.87085054088632
 gardiner who fatigued by the exercise of the morning found elizabeths arm inadequate to her support and consequently preferred her husbands         8.7489692473977
 darcy took her place by her niece and they walked on together         9.67366921484475
 after a short silence the lady first spoke         16.56267322585356
 bingley and his sisters         24.89648461542547
 bingleys name had been last mentioned between them and if she might judge from his complexion his mind was not very differently engaged         7.66981889878659
 the surprise of such an application was great indeed it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it         5.483437576405171
 she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother and without looking farther it was satisfactory it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her         4.848087879297172
 they now walked on in silence each of them deep in thought         13.141280534862435
 elizabeth was not comfortable that was impossible but she was flattered and pleased         8.41680490333238
 his wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind         7.753624357708347
 they soon outstripped the others and when they had reached the carriage mr         16.463006719577447
 gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind         20.17568075191869
 he then asked her to walk into the housebut she declared herself not tired and they stood together on the lawn         6.940470210623487
 at such a time much might have been said and silence was very awkward         7.032270283588566
 she wanted to talk but there seemed an embargo on every subject         10.034757973033356
 at last she recollected that she had been travelling and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance         6.374000120509555
 yet time and her aunt moved slowlyand her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the têteàtête was over         6.9138829811306834
 on mr         176.7006075788634
 gardiners coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment but this was declined and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness         5.617168042510155
 darcy handed the ladies into the carriage and when it drove off elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house         7.902631940822593
 the observations of her uncle and aunt now began and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected         4.601714995757302
 he is perfectly well behaved polite and unassuming said her uncle         12.544703073196091
 there is something a little stately in him to be sure replied her aunt but it is confined to his air and is not unbecoming         6.688559984122762
 i can now say with the housekeeper that though some people may call him proud i have seen nothing of it         6.998123454221688
 i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us         7.748541060861849
 it was more than civil it was really attentive and there was no necessity for such attention         7.126230945705279
 his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling         21.395338025192324
 but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable         10.340237224554324
 elizabeth excused herself as well as she could said that she had liked him better when they met in kent than before and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning         4.741561235284343
 but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities replied her uncle         9.154702838090383
 your great men often are and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing as he might change his mind another day and warn me off his grounds         6.4342550572134884
 elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character but said nothing         10.70351936408293
 from what we have seen of him continued mrs         13.600856282762019
 gardiner i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body as he has done by poor wickham         6.14455654505829
 he has not an illnatured look         25.59223811824727
 on the contrary there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks         13.70438240474064
 and there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart         6.308427030704822
 but to be sure the good lady who shewed us the house did give him a most flaming character         5.728453062000579
 i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes         21.080395143088833
 but he is a liberal master i suppose and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue         6.617667070067586
 elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham and therefore gave them to understand in as guarded a manner as she could that by what she had heard from his relations in kent his actions were capable of a very different construction and that his character was by no means so faulty nor wickhams so amiable as they had been considered in hertfordshire         3.811998336428844
 in confirmation of this she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected without actually naming her authority but stating it to be such as might be relied on         5.553351769915077
 gardiner was surprised and concerned but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures every idea gave way to the charm of recollection and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of any thing else         4.642926179583668
 fatigued as she had been by the mornings walk they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance         4.615929429784536
 darcys civility and above all of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister         9.677709146665011
 chapter ii         13367.620200875554
 elizabeth had settled it that mr         35.34246726020548
 darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching pemberley and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning         6.037696077788759
 but her conclusion was false for on the very morning after their own arrival at lambton these visitors came         7.390570164702311
 they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle driving up the street         4.471101259807286
 elizabeth immediately recognising the livery guessed what it meant and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she expected         7.721370375154101
 her uncle and aunt were all amazement and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke joined to the circumstance itself and many of the circumstances of the preceding day opened to them a new idea on the business         4.374396850114867
 nothing had ever suggested it before but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece         5.494384336699033
 while these newlyborn notions were passing in their heads the perturbation of elizabeths feelings was every moment increasing         11.864650994386972
 she was quite amazed at her own discomposure but amongst other causes of disquiet she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour and more than commonly anxious to please she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her         4.73018414647692
 she retreated from the window fearful of being seen and as she walked up and down the room endeavouring to compose herself saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made every thing worse         4.671018195321839
 miss darcy and her brother appeared and this formidable introduction took place         10.319036737173302
 with astonishment did elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself         8.953393969935291
 she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable         8.825391066061451
 miss darcy was tall and on a larger scale than elizabeth and though little more than sixteen her figure was formed and her appearance womanly and graceful         6.125458783753565
 she was less handsome than her brother but there was sense and good humour in her face and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle         6.026370476280124
 elizabeth who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr         6.917461528669649
 darcy had been was much relieved by discerning such different feelings         11.977563279038275
 they had not been long together before darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her and she had barely time to express her satisfaction and prepare for such a visitor when bingleys quick step was heard on the stairs and in a moment he entered the room         4.2674023976617175
 all elizabeths anger against him had been long done away but had she still felt any it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again         5.994369994137748
 he enquired in a friendly though general way after her family and looked and spoke with the same goodhumoured ease that he had ever done         6.443820465220477
 to mr         75.9321085297702
 gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself         11.181807410393601
 they had long wished to see him         23.202053036885715
 the whole party before them indeed excited a lively attention         18.046304364421996
 the suspicions which had just arisen of mr         22.132865830405517
 darcy and their niece directed their observation towards each with an earnest though guarded enquiry and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love         5.101959977904685
 of the ladys sensations they remained a little in doubt but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough         6.98406091876154
 elizabeth on her side had much to do         12.512627311149847
 bingley was ready georgiana was eager and darcy determined to be pleased         12.70496410380832
 in seeing bingley her thoughts naturally flew to her sister and oh         10.77239379923341
 how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner         11.897255924459913
 sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her he was trying to trace a resemblance         5.33956091625508
 but though this might be imaginary she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy who had been set up as a rival of jane         5.041018987513079
 no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard         19.50689488053119
 nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister         16.2535829971443
 on this point she was soon satisfied and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted which in her anxious interpretation denoted a recollection of jane not untinctured by tenderness and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her had he dared         4.775122679205452
 he observed to her at a moment when the others were talking together and in a tone which had something of real regret that it was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her and before she could reply he added it is above eight months         3.8464197901123747
 we have not met since the th of november when we were all dancing together at netherfield         8.008286580492085
 elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact and he afterwards took occasion to ask her when unattended to by any of the rest whether all her sisters were at longbourn         5.1112676952677365
 there was not much in the question nor in the preceding remark but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning         6.070653324862282
 it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr         8.570265087018079
 when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace when she saw him thus civil not only to herself but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage the difference the change was so great and struck so forcibly on her mind that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible         3.963057086152489
 never even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield or his dignified relations at rosings had she seen him so desirous to please so free from selfconsequence or unbending reserve as now when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings         4.527555716869825
 their visitors staid with them above half an hour and when they arose to depart mr         10.322955280661864
 darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing mr         9.298354471835301
 gardiner and miss bennet to dinner at pemberley before they left the country         9.647654769428422
 miss darcy though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations readily obeyed         7.271059204244896
 gardiner looked at her niece desirous of knowing how she whom the invitation most concerned felt disposed as to its acceptance but elizabeth had turned away her head         5.848082802007852
 presuming however that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal and seeing in her husband who was fond of society a perfect willingness to accept it she ventured to engage for her attendance and the day after the next was fixed on         5.007254626416312
 bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again having still a great deal to say to her and many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends         5.582189613344143
 elizabeth construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister was pleased and on this account as well as some others found herself when their visitors left them capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been little         5.184864279725523
 eager to be alone and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley and then hurried away to dress         4.996472946325232
 but she had no reason to fear mr         9.155102315535762
 gardiners curiosity it was not their wish to force her communication         16.641283974084416
 it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr         12.955794533938564
 they saw much to interest but nothing to justify enquiry         15.428419594302769
 of mr         79.38452635533254
 they could not be untouched by his politeness and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servants report without any reference to any other account the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognised it for mr         4.792222307074332
 there was now an interest however in believing the housekeeper and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old and whose own manners indicated respectability was not to be hastily rejected         4.278477538417227
 neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight         8.245756616518491
 it was acknowledged however that he was a liberal man and did much good among the poor         7.267489981742265
 with respect to wickham the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood it was yet a well known fact that on his quitting derbyshire he had left many debts behind him which mr         4.548565099918014
 darcy afterwards discharged         2689.345937537105
 as for elizabeth her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last and the evening though as it passed it seemed long was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out         4.73411385851384
 she certainly did not hate him         34.156757202883064
 no hatred had vanished long ago and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him that could be so called         7.494319813129916
 the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities though at first unwillingly admitted had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his favour and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light which yesterday had produced         4.906680555972666
 but above all above respect and esteem there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked         6.866903859015427
 it was gratitude         269.83040140185466
 such a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but gratitudefor to love ardent love it must be attributed and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged as by no means unpleasing though it could not be exactly defined         4.649240225082417
 she respected she esteemed she was grateful to him she felt a real interest in his welfare and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power which her fancy told her she still possessed of bringing on the renewal of his addresses         4.268290123277013
 it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and niece that such a striking civility as miss darcys in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley for she had reached it only to a late breakfast ought to be imitated though it could not be equalled by some exertion of politeness on their side and consequently that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning         3.5784875068220945
 they were therefore to go         53.38492994548289
elizabeth was pleased though when she asked herself the reason she had very little to say in reply         6.42871060689589
 gardiner left them soon after breakfast         47.94001141407426
 the fishing scheme had been renewed the day before and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon         6.486413562392862
 chapter iii         13367.620200875554
 convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingleys dislike of her had originated in jealousy she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her and was curious to know with how much civility on that ladys side the acquaintance would now be renewed         4.544073747912572
 on reaching the house they were shewn through the hall into the saloon whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer         7.632242875238272
 its windows opening to the ground admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn         7.020100223045578
 in this room they were received by miss darcy who was sitting there with mrs         9.11265735996467
 hurst and miss bingley and the lady with whom she lived in london         7.057628478086055
 georgianas reception of them was very civil but attended with all that embarrassment which though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved         5.94604562677839
 gardiner and her niece however did her justice and pitied her         9.435969372715858
 hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey and on their being seated a pause awkward as such pauses must always be succeeded for a few moments         4.9433359416606875
 annesley a genteel agreeablelooking woman whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others and between her and mrs         6.954906513557083
 gardiner with occasional help from elizabeth the conversation was carried on         17.260079705913327
 miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard         6.186414475809038
 elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley and that she could not speak a word especially to miss darcy without calling her attention         5.087258223922438
 this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much         5.256814987355068
 her own thoughts were employing her         49.60090870308352
 she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room         9.24369138325512
 after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing miss bingleys voice elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family         5.304063323643559
 she answered with equal indifference and brevity and the other said no more         9.448664005728604
 the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat cake and a variety of all the finest fruits in season but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs         5.380518070008546
 annesley to miss darcy had been given to remind her of her post         12.021452850823309
 there was now employment for the whole party for though they could not all talk they could all eat and the beautiful pyramids of grapes nectarines and peaches soon collected them round the table         5.527367828491872
 while thus engaged elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr         8.396903126834804
 darcy by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room and then though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate she began to regret that he came         5.147971785864719
 he had been some time with mr         19.23251198348925
 gardiner who with two or three other gentlemen from the house was engaged by the river and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning         5.271741722504416
 no sooner did he appear than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrasseda resolution the more necessary to be made but perhaps not the more easily kept because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room         4.317420989645197
 in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingleys in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects for jealousy had not yet made her desperate and her attentions to mr         4.965032955255969
 darcy were by no means over         19.81809400958151
 miss bingley saw all this likewise and in the imprudence of anger took the first opportunity of saying with sneering civility pray miss eliza are not the shire militia removed from meryton         6.301712979375783
 they must be a great loss to your family         10.19493384278043
 in darcys presence she dared not mention wickhams name but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moments distress but exerting herself vigorously to repel the illnatured attack she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone         5.437351796677541
 while she spoke an involuntary glance shewed her darcy with an heightened complexion earnestly looking at her and his sister overcome with confusion and unable to lift up her eyes         5.599693119439058
 had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcys opinion and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps         4.501282975980149
 not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcys meditated elopement         13.435546834919435
 he had certainly formed such a plan and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend         5.267932793752156
 elizabeths collected behaviour however soon quieted his emotion and as miss bingley vexed and disappointed dared not approach nearer to wickham georgiana also recovered in time though not enough to be able to speak any more         6.242458648365053
 darcy was attending them to their carriage miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeths person behaviour and dress         7.758893473544969
 but georgiana would not join her         39.70059936685874
 her brothers recommendation was enough to ensure her favour his judgment could not err and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable         6.211710461064448
 how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning mr         19.736336755865302
 darcy she cried i never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter         4.559122072210112
 she is grown so brown and coarse         32.0021984127077
 louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again         10.37398616161621
 darcy might have liked such an address he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tannedno miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer         5.891586792111747
 for my own part she rejoined i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her         6.243255995620385
 her face is too thin her complexion has no brilliancy and her features are not at all handsome         7.281266988788001
 her nose wants character there is nothing marked in its lines         23.95391452925699
 her teeth are tolerable but not out of the common way and as for her eyes which have sometimes been called so fine i never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them         6.547296889405104
 they have a sharp shrewish look which i do not like at all and in her air altogether there is a selfsufficiency without fashion which is intolerable         5.115316669885003
 persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth this was not the best method of recommending herself but angry people are not always wise and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled she had all the success she expected         5.251218446811073
 he was resolutely silent however and from a determination of making him speak she continued i remember when we first knew her in hertfordshire how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty and i particularly recollect your saying one night after they had been dining at netherfield she a beauty         4.926186510222869
i should as soon call her mother a wit         12.710461802649379
 but afterwards she seemed to improve on you and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time         6.796260309979604
 yes replied darcy who could contain himself no longer but that was only when i first knew her for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance         5.626437277104943
 he then went away and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself         6.071399815525232
 gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit as they returned except what had particularly interested them both         5.543499557638682
 the looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention         5.753771734038771
 they talked of his sister his friends his house his fruit of every thing but himself yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs         6.373332854247087
 gardiner thought of him and mrs         32.865169222127136
 gardiner would have been highly gratified by her nieces beginning the subject         11.841028595287188
 elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane on their first arrival at lambton and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there but on the third her repining was over and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere         4.112264488820558
 they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in and her uncle and aunt leaving her to enjoy them in quiet set off by themselves         5.003856129459077
 the one missent must be first attended to it had been written five days ago         9.679250617210414
 the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements with such news as the country afforded but the latter half which was dated a day later and written in evident agitation gave more important intelligence         5.96471064641181
 it was to this effect since writing the above dearest lizzy something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature but i am afraid of alarming yoube assured that we are all well         4.186531936092731
 what i have to say relates to poor lydia         10.93315155910391
 an express came at twelve last night just as we were all gone to bed from colonel forster to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers to own the truth with wickham         5.607856986885359
 to kitty however it does not seem so wholly unexpected         13.579656980896738
 i am very very sorry         53.494517114881404
 so imprudent a match on both sides         26.945965557251167
but i am willing to hope the best and that his character has been misunderstood         7.529730961541516
 thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him but this step and let us rejoice over it marks nothing bad at heart         9.407567483206487
 his choice is disinterested at least for he must know my father can give her nothing         9.064345813664959
 our poor mother is sadly grieved         74.5761689956792
 my father bears it better         174.22595064923829
 how thankful am i that we never let them know what has been said against him we must forget it ourselves         8.94795577136801
 they were off saturday night about twelve as is conjectured but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight         7.943212943376091
 the express was sent off directly         15.917508727441819
 my dear lizzy they must have passed within ten miles of us         13.955370612426043
 colonel forster gives us reason to expect him here soon         36.33294754934894
 lydia left a few lines for his wife informing her of their intention         10.73469150387302
 i am afraid you will not be able to make it out but i hardly know what i have written         3.8491915187307324
 without allowing herself time for consideration and scarcely knowing what she felt elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the other and opening it with the utmost impatience read as follows it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first         5.28407349909902
 by this time my dearest sister you have received my hurried letter i wish this may be more intelligible but though not confined for time my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer for being coherent         5.562229048353434
 dearest lizzy i hardly know what i would write but i have bad news for you and it cannot be delayed         6.963956223630931
 imprudent as a marriage between mr         34.872988336841
 wickham and our poor lydia would be we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland         4.614781869048791
 colonel forster came yesterday having left brighton the day before not many hours after the express         13.792663230984484
 though lydias short letter to mrs         66.97910199922454
 gave them to understand that they were going to gretna green something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that w         5.485147785383409
 never intended to go there or to marry lydia at all which was repeated to colonel f         8.27365006758475
 who instantly taking the alarm set off from b         26.12653742324909
 intending to trace their route         182.75475728430035
 all that is known after this is that they were seen to continue the london road         7.382576565412129
 i know not what to think         16.3347556969638
 after making every possible enquiry on that side london colonel f         15.641051701103613
 i am sincerely grieved for him and mrs         31.305157294602232
 but no one can throw any blame on them         14.933627722483852
 our distress my dear lizzy is very great         28.35199477724879
 my father and mother believe the worst but i cannot think so ill of him         5.785294602658406
 many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of lydias connections which is not likely can i suppose her so lost to every thing         4.78080456888016
 i grieve to find however that colonel f         18.69037004354092
 is not disposed to depend upon their marriage he shook his head when i expressed my hopes and said he feared w         6.885618775493209
 was not a man to be trusted         11.45481757572527
 my poor mother is really ill and keeps her room         18.51276581901139
 could she exert herself it would be better but this is not to be expected and as to my father i never in my life saw him so affected         4.288889358243107
 poor kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder         8.943148736341199
 i am truly glad dearest lizzy that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes but now as the first shock is over shall i own that i long for your return         6.1616812891066335
 i am not so selfish however as to press for it if inconvenient         10.00939823454136
 adieu         20990.2
 i take up my pen again to do what i have just told you i would not but circumstances are such that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible         5.034088121585507
 i know my dear uncle and aunt so well that i am not afraid of requesting it though i have still something more to ask of the former         4.029351340721996
 my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly to try to discover her         9.131972437999462
 what he means to do i am sure i know not but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again tomorrow evening         4.744406832674356
 in such an exigence my uncles advice and assistance would be every thing in the world he will immediately comprehend what i must feel and i rely upon his goodness         5.178667811564511
 cried elizabeth darting from her seat as she finished the letter in eagerness to follow him without losing a moment of the time so precious but as she reached the door it was opened by a servant and mr         5.951443660641947
 darcy appeared         855.0291670698532
 i must find mr         111.26954356863223
 gardiner this moment on business that cannot be delayed i have not an instant to lose         9.450792421264902
 good god         3226.375601050649
 what is the matter         30.132050993061288
 cried he with more feeling than politeness then recollecting himself i will not detain you a minute but let me or let the servant go after mr         6.099668950243673
 you are not well enoughyou cannot go yourself         15.57896432308209
 elizabeth hesitated but her knees trembled under her and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them         7.1151338445184935
 calling back the servant therefore she commissioned him though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible to fetch his master and mistress home instantly         6.7453102644317715
 on his quitting the room she sat down unable to support herself and looking so miserably ill that it was impossible for darcy to leave her or to refrain from saying in a tone of gentleness and commiseration let me call your maid         4.599827188784744
 is there nothing you could take to give you present relief         11.97346661391493
a glass of wineshall i get you one         20.184999190743564
you are very ill         71.88235721548338
 no i thank you she replied endeavouring to recover herself         15.874084674801152
 there is nothing the matter with me         20.578359777646966
 i am quite well         148.52829075182947
 i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn         8.743130739092857
 she burst into tears as she alluded to it and for a few minutes could not speak another word         6.96599289428953
 darcy in wretched suspense could only say something indistinctly of his concern and observe her in compassionate silence         8.582811224566491
 at length she spoke again         67.85218936363258
 i have just had a letter from jane with such dreadful news         8.713128171049028
 it cannot be concealed from any one         23.107048073682595
 my youngest sister has left all her friendshas elopedhas thrown herself into the power ofof mr         10.643967866123518
 they are gone off together from brighton         30.312573942261448
 she has no money no connections nothing that can tempt him toshe is lost for ever         7.340630404865923
 when i consider she added in a yet more agitated voice that i might have prevented it         7.74009603466146
i who knew what he was         35.95213262744821
 had i but explained some part of it onlysome part of what i learnt to my own family         6.525618525809112
 had his character been known this could not have happened         13.404748697936661
 i am grieved indeed cried darcy grievedshocked         40.99626451668228
 but is it certain absolutely certain         20.455013222601824
they left brighton together on sunday night and were traced almost to london but not beyond they are certainly not gone to scotland         7.239962008195853
 my father is gone to london and jane has written to beg my uncles immediate assistance and we shall be off i hope in half an hour         5.900675040617951
 how is such a man to be worked on         10.590049178243696
 how are they even to be discovered         23.822247366207336
 i have not the smallest hope         16.067162350114845
 it is every way horrible         36.34002341093188
 darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence         30.511200414476047
 when my eyes were opened to his real character         15.684442847973052
oh         4997.666666666667
 had i known what i ought what i dared to do         11.539258423130267
 but i knew noti was afraid of doing too much         14.019524425311166
 wretched wretched mistake         6873.455842926922
 darcy made no answer         77.06171148382424
 he seemed scarcely to hear her and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation his brow contracted his air gloomy         6.229216444602249
 elizabeth soon observed and instantly understood it         32.27574005592762
 her power was sinking every thing must sink under such a proof of family weakness such an assurance of the deepest disgrace         6.389407072802005
 it was on the contrary exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him as now when all love must be vain         4.341442483604676
 but self though it would intrude could not engross her         19.098705208986285
 lydiathe humiliation the misery she was bringing on them all soon swallowed up every private care and covering her face with her handkerchief elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else and after a pause of several minutes was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion who in a manner which though it spoke compassion spoke likewise restraint said i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay but real though unavailing concern         4.313501146476679
 would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress         6.553321308825146
but i will not torment you with vain wishes which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks         6.1840229353814316
 this unfortunate affair will i fear prevent my sisters having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley today         10.244625564306999
 be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy         10.29132441108747
 say that urgent business calls us home immediately         31.148052794269013
 conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible         17.32494630114221
i know it cannot be long         25.355727198557904
 he readily assured her of his secrecyagain expressed his sorrow for her distress wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope and leaving his compliments for her relations with only one serious parting look went away         5.712777281798999
 as he quitted the room elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance so full of contradictions and varieties sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination         4.6889563307815925
 if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection elizabeths change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty         7.5498296840990875
 but if otherwise if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object and even before two words have been exchanged nothing can be said in her defence except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for wickham and that its illsuccess might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment         4.524376445760412
 be that as it may she saw him go with regret and in this early example of what lydias infamy must produce found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business         4.830019312944914
 never since reading janes second letter had she entertained a hope of wickhams meaning to marry her         10.5365953747371
 no one but jane she thought could flatter herself with such an expectation         9.64951909582834
 while the contents of the first letter remained on her mind she was all surpriseall astonishment that wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible         5.691166367977285
 but now it was all too natural         19.00478577447807
 for such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey         4.241378558997763
 she had never perceived while the regiment was in hertfordshire that lydia had any partiality for him but she was convinced that lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body         5.110464129992507
 sometimes one officer sometimes another had been her favourite as their attentions raised them in her opinion         11.539171151883185
 her affections had been continually fluctuating but never without an object         14.474374841072137
 the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl         11.957891966706223
oh         4997.666666666667
 how acutely did she now feel it         43.797949510221095
 she was wild to be at hometo hear to see to be upon the spot to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her in a family so deranged a father absent a mother incapable of exertion and requiring constant attendance and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia her uncles interference seemed of the utmost importance and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience was severe         4.43070769984188
 gardiner had hurried back in alarm supposing by the servants account that their niece was taken suddenly illbut satisfying them instantly on that head she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons reading the two letters aloud and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy         5.378705517143182
 gardiner could not but be deeply affected         19.064097007528293
 not lydia only but all were concerned in it and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror mr         7.3668075567677995
 gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power         40.76293428716262
elizabeth though expecting no less thanked him with tears of gratitude and all three being actuated by one spirit every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled         6.942934406006907
 they were to be off as soon as possible         8.434262650951004
 but what is to be done about pemberley         9.476166934864965
 john told us mr         554.8231891893638
 darcy was here when you sent for uswas it so         14.031512856763403
 yes and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement         6.306107550847309
 that is all settled         36.30343968716553
 that is all settled repeated the other as she ran into her room to prepare         6.946787423070921
 and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth         7.929088893455276
 oh that i knew how it was         16.5733689510594
 but wishes were vain or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour         7.031124317279328
 had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself but she had her share of business as well as her aunt and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in lambton with false excuses for their sudden departure         4.586377993681523
 an hour however saw the whole completed and mr         22.243233713168113
 gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn nothing remained to be done but to go and elizabeth after all the misery of the morning found herself in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed seated in the carriage and on the road to longbourn         4.833592240009384
 i have been thinking it over again elizabeth said her uncle as they drove from the town and really upon serious consideration i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter         5.16377801514456
 could he expect that her friends would not step forward         15.258689209422487
 could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment after such an affront to colonel forster         7.801689278474312
 his temptation is not adequate to the risk         22.549880772914303
 do you really think so         55.23244909494654
 cried elizabeth brightening up for a moment         72.92576578825732
 upon my word said mrs         74.79425239465431
 gardiner i begin to be of your uncles opinion         22.071521572032903
 not perhaps of neglecting his own interest         17.23722252027067
 if indeed it should be so         29.61584957679452
 but i dare not hope it         28.144100508826902
 why should they not go on to scotland if that had been the case         9.625478834184126
 in the first place replied mr         14.334514111579578
 gardiner there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland         6.388731946879868
 but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption         10.896296885138888
 and besides no traces of them were to be found on the barnet road         8.861917754840677
 well thensupposing them to be in london         31.542006069490558
 they may be there though for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptionable purpose         8.750515360084538
 it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side and it might strike them that they could be more economically though less expeditiously married in london than in scotland         4.993940418299711
 but why all this secrecy         53.25700004944169
 why any fear of detection         112.51736473937805
 why must their marriage be private         43.21056752354208
 no no this is not likely         28.79434078460306
 his most particular friend you see by janes account was persuaded of his never intending to marry her         8.559916335064813
 wickham will never marry a woman without some money         19.24505550119177
 he cannot afford it         233.03183833600212
 and what claims has lydia what attractions has she beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well         6.140815231169036
 as to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce         4.726967741550671
 but as to your other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good         7.032093164427721
 lydia has no brothers to step forward and he might imagine from my fathers behaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that he would do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in such a matter         4.506332635545519
 but can you think that lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage         5.006131356357311
 it does seem and it is most shocking indeed replied elizabeth with tears in her eyes that a sisters sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt         5.707578174243192
 but really i know not what to say         11.011621119129694
 perhaps i am not doing her justice         27.960033393812903
 but she is very young she has never been taught to think on serious subjects and for the last half year nay for a twelvemonth she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity         5.1267609998204815
 she has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give greaterwhat shall i call it         6.494213023660875
 susceptibility to her feelings which are naturally lively enough         18.744627371379988
 and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman         6.9066923050699005
 but you see that jane said her aunt does not think so ill of wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt         5.885635695925485
 of whom does jane ever think ill         26.810024773764564
 and who is there whatever might be their former conduct that she would believe capable of such an attempt till it were proved against them         5.87268222062398
 but jane knows as well as i do what wickham really is         9.450465844554504
 we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word         10.176825528312667
 that he has neither integrity nor honour         20.152623884290147
 that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating         9.777303323050546
 and do you really know all this         13.36526191692
 gardiner whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive         14.788642676714172
 i do indeed replied elizabeth colouring         36.2878265709713
 i told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to mr         9.993295893190105
 darcy and you yourself when last at longbourn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him         4.8541438856921
 and there are other circumstances which i am not at libertywhich it is not worth while to relate but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless         5.3648821043061785
 from what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud reserved disagreeable girl         6.692951553941932
 he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her         8.924337374512614
 but does lydia know nothing of this         28.97736317545776
 can she be ignorant of what you and jane seem so well to understand         8.569073918276759
that that is the worst of all         14.38995074633225
 till i was in kent and saw so much both of mr         9.893677537446823
 darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam i was ignorant of the truth myself         7.802552455542721
 and when i returned home the shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnights time         6.598139421251748
 as that was the case neither jane to whom i related the whole nor i thought it necessary to make our knowledge public for of what use could it apparently be to any one that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown         4.302299263504119
 and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mrs         7.82709676294173
 that she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head         7.2699812467067915
 that such a consequence as this should ensue you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts         6.87364705486761
 when they all removed to brighton therefore you had no reason i suppose to believe them fond of each other         7.073556034903229
 not the slightest         470.813101394535
 i can remember no symptom of affection on either side and had any thing of the kind been perceptible you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away         5.043752330538263
 when first he entered the corps she was ready enough to admire him but so we all were         7.127112825847034
 it may be easily believed that however little of novelty could be added to their fears hopes and conjectures on this interesting subject by its repeated discussion no other could detain them from it long during the whole of the journey         4.630802178086588
 from elizabeths thoughts it was never absent         44.17934209928254
 fixed there by the keenest of all anguish self reproach she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness         8.1933346721804
 they travelled as expeditiously as possible and sleeping one night on the road reached longbourn by dinnertime the next day         8.903838491128528
 it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations         5.76521391266916
 the little gardiners attracted by the sight of a chaise were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock and when the carriage drove up to the door the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies in a variety of capers and frisks was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome         3.929414661185274
 elizabeth jumped out and after giving each of them an hasty kiss hurried into the vestibule where jane who came running down stairs from her mothers apartment immediately met her         7.255125570850742
 elizabeth as she affectionately embraced her whilst tears filled the eyes of both lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives         5.415664918729831
 not yet replied jane         119.78888429558319
 but now that my dear uncle is come i hope every thing will be well         8.14475757491296
 is my father in town         49.31972072452297
 and have you heard from him often         14.756428198243729
 we have heard only once         73.38634042714068
 he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety and to give me his directions which i particularly begged him to do         6.103860352798431
 and my motherhow is she         100.63938887787265
 how are you all         79.35082515081382
 my mother is tolerably well i trust though her spirits are greatly shaken         10.786854651737809
 she is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all         9.431946294720397
 she does not yet leave her dressingroom         21.80890936361841
 mary and kitty thank heaven         72.66274238426875
 are quite well         501.53933882674227
 but youhow are you         334.56800759119807
 you look pale         1274.4810068646445
 how much you must have gone through         23.26079192295155
 her sister however assured her of her being perfectly well and their conversation which had been passing while mr         7.6650824932588595
 gardiner were engaged with their children was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party         5.1056017326837315
 the sanguine hope of good however which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her she still expected that it would all end well and that every morning would bring some letter either from lydia or her father to explain their proceedings and perhaps announce the marriage         5.419883635467093
 bennet to whose apartment they all repaired after a few minutes conversation together received them exactly as might be expected with tears and lamentations of regret invectives against the villanous conduct of wickham and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing         4.39800126576972
 why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight         11.114049006987344
 i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after         5.937258766958629
 i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her but i was overruled as i always am         7.189020875289507
 poor dear child         2239.2953692656033
 and now heres mr         286.1605776079061
 bennet gone away and i know he will fight wickham wherever he meets him and then he will be killed and what is to become of us all         4.779627900420104
 the collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave and if you are not kind to us brother i do not know what we shall do         4.954056059552939
 they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas and mr         21.301064712688163
 gardiner after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family told her that he meant to be in london the very next day and would assist mr         4.783607738097528
 bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia         19.322181497987145
 do not give way to useless alarm added he though it is right to be prepared for the worst there is no occasion to look on it as certain         5.155034741482297
 it is not quite a week since they left brighton         10.945745452321617
 in a few days more we may gain some news of them and till we know that they are not married and have no design of marrying do not let us give the matter over as lost         4.25888656248719
 as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother and make him come home with me to gracechurch street and then we may consult together as to what is to be done         4.172054957340945
 bennet that is exactly what i could most wish for         7.560546515530226
 and now do when you get to town find them out wherever they may be and if they are not married already make them marry         5.588268581106133
 and as for wedding clothes do not let them wait for that but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses to buy them after they are married         5.043906789504423
 and above all things keep mr         31.577510134598516
 bennet from fighting         1894.718414459886
 tell him what a dreadful state i am inthat i am frightened out of my wits and have such tremblings such flutterings all over me such spasms in my side and pains in my head and such beatings at heart that i can get no rest by night nor by day         5.049985005683668
 and tell my dear lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me for she does not know which are the best warehouses         5.539072630925484
 oh brother how kind you are         72.88488407237874
 i know you will contrive it all         15.899040608091797
 gardiner though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause could not avoid recommending moderation to her as well in her hopes as her fears and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper who attended in the absence of her daughters         4.593078024741282
 though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family they did not attempt to oppose it for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants while they waited at table and judged it better that one only of the household and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject         4.094197372839833
 in the diningroom they were soon joined by mary and kitty who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before         6.596716672544673
 one came from her books and the other from her toilette         12.76533845973698
 as for mary she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection soon after they were seated at table this is a most unfortunate affair and will probably be much talked of         5.306719756344943
 but we must stem the tide of malice and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation         6.697867783192204
 elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement but was too much oppressed to make any reply         11.525549180970259
 mary however continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them         9.612959602170912
 in the afternoon the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries which jane was equally eager to satisfy         5.2629831308626365
 after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event which elizabeth considered as all but certain and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible the former continued the subject by saying but tell me all and every thing about it which i have not already heard         5.189510837815827
 give me farther particulars         198.03413075800634
 had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place         9.816240758285293
 they must have seen them together for ever         17.837814061356838
 colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality especially on lydias side but nothing to give him any alarm         9.434123292177398
 i am so grieved for him         31.907291684660365
 he was coming to us in order to assure us of his concern before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland when that apprehension first got abroad it hastened his journey         5.396628883402931
 and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry         16.425132170426917
 did he know of their intending to go off         16.303367038345357
 yes but when questioned by him denny denied knowing any thing of their plan and would not give his real opinion about it         6.914180014909175
 he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marryingand from that i am inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before         5.395368648563208
 and till colonel forster came himself not one of you entertained a doubt i suppose of their being really married         7.400321119281923
 how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains         9.32078606319778
 my father and mother knew nothing of that they only felt how imprudent a match it must be         6.680026623430958
 she had known it seems of their being in love with each other many weeks         8.011740572254352
 but not before they went to brighton         20.166273944194597
 and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself         9.781809697422387
 does he know his real character         40.842699798878606
 i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did         7.501090393838342
 he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant         14.831252331446157
 and since this sad affair has taken place it is said that he left meryton greatly in debt but i hope this may be false         6.164072076298722
 perhaps it would have been better replied her sister         11.646292282446536
 but to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were seemed unjustifiable         8.358706977124529
 we acted with the best intentions         49.74710409971196
 could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydias note to his wife         15.86879530227757
 he brought it with him for us to see         14.338408769474704
 jane then took it from her pocketbook and gave it to elizabeth         13.757044446578428
 these were the contents my dear harriet you will laugh when you know where i am gone and i cannot help laughing myself at your surprise tomorrow morning as soon as i am missed         4.8359541725744135
 i am going to gretna green and if you cannot guess with who i shall think you a simpleton for there is but one man in the world i love and he is an angel         4.5870358357654375
 i should never be happy without him so think it no harm to be off         9.001322115983696
 you need not send them word at longbourn of my going if you do not like it for it will make the surprise the greater when i write to them and sign my name lydia wickham         5.112699068579671
 what a good joke it will be         20.77271857413836
 i can hardly write for laughing         40.274650372447326
 pray make my excuses to pratt for not keeping my engagement and dancing with him tonight         10.190536879845183
 tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all and tell him i will dance with him at the next ball we meet with great pleasure         5.328327990035536
 i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up         6.200393855636157
 good bye         3838.148357502032
 give my love to colonel forster i hope you will drink to our good journey         8.154298377956122
 your affectionate friend lydia bennet         101.15521178358243
 thoughtless thoughtless lydia         8197.106995953833
 cried elizabeth when she had finished it         13.534496248438915
 what a letter is this to be written at such a moment         8.25264505065694
 but at least it shews that she was serious in the object of her journey         8.171794993202855
 whatever he might afterwards persuade her to it was not on her side a scheme of infamy         8.887844169821953
 my poor father         689.3336514698984
 how he must have felt it         30.66516189255821
 i never saw any one so shocked         17.56959319593998
 he could not speak a word for full ten minutes         8.392299790877544
 my mother was taken ill immediately and the whole house in such confusion         8.864009004550752
 jane cried elizabeth was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day         6.153491994548829
i hope there was         92.4434453862848
but to be guarded at such a time is very difficult         7.005468706324875
 your attendance upon her has been too much for you         22.30806472878051
 you do not look well         39.21809295561865
 that i had been with you you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone         7.0425340801719605
 mary and kitty have been very kind and would have shared in every fatigue i am sure but i did not think it right for either of them         5.309587575812506
 kitty is slight and delicate and mary studies so much that her hours of repose should not be broken in on         8.306909934880766
 she was of great use and comfort to us all and lady lucas has been very kind she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us and offered her services or any of her daughters if they could be of use to us         4.3759208446633435
 she had better have stayed at home cried elizabeth perhaps she meant well but under such a misfortune as this one cannot see too little of ones neighbours         5.983780786227997
 assistance is impossible condolence insufferable         128.9679683441829
 she then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue while in town for the recovery of his daughter         6.397391757068203
 he meant i believe replied jane to go to epsom the place where they last changed horses see the postilions and try if any thing could be made out from them         5.51244487130936
 his principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham         9.914294441920813
 it had come with a fare from london and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and ladys removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make enquiries at clapham         5.1968358485495045
 if he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare he determined to make enquiries there and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach         4.9817115071139755
 bennet the next morning but the post came in without bringing a single line from him         8.493912362567993
 his family knew him to be on all common occasions a most negligent and dilatory correspondent but at such a time they had hoped for exertion         6.100601322802641
 they were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to send but even of that they would have been glad to be certain         4.850388072825599
 gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off         17.610617180805615
 when he was gone they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on and their uncle promised at parting to prevail on mr         5.624925886404698
 gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces         5.570734170118207
 she shared in their attendance on mrs         26.45078167676845
 their other aunt also visited them frequently and always as she said with the design of cheering and heartening them up though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickhams extravagance or irregularity she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them         5.057984380962239
 all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who but three months before had been almost an angel of light         8.349858425802372
 he was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place and his intrigues all honoured with the title of seduction had been extended into every tradesmans family         5.902007348965386
 every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world and every body began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness         4.58774333355099
 elizabeth though she did not credit above half of what was said believed enough to make her former assurance of her sisters ruin still more certain and even jane who believed still less of it became almost hopeless more especially as the time was now come when if they had gone to scotland which she had never before entirely despaired of they must in all probability have gained some news of them         4.1544052500609245
 gardiner left longbourn on sunday on tuesday his wife received a letter from him it told them that on his arrival he had immediately found out his brother and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street         5.813921646316567
 that mr         123.04921125506934
 gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure but as his brother was eager in it he meant to assist him in pursuing it         6.473709580103611
 he added that mr         65.24495887971831
 bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave london and promised to write again very soon         9.705533792385545
 there was also a postscript to this effect         17.739863664804986
 i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out if possible from some of the young mans intimates in the regiment whether wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself         4.268054552835872
 if there were any one that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that it might be of essential consequence         5.820406085524849
 at present we have nothing to guide us         23.177241157071297
 but on second thoughts perhaps lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any other person         7.770806613917508
 elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved         3.8492940987570465
 every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected         6.873305497235238
 the arrival of letters was the first grand object of every mornings impatience         8.908307758287101
 through letters whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance         8.141965531175611
 but before they heard again from mr         19.95592605857458
 gardiner a letter arrived for their father from a different quarter from mr         11.22709260766381
 collins which as jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence she accordingly read and elizabeth who knew what curiosities his letters always were looked over her and read it likewise         5.237051144537926
 it was as follows my dear sir i feel myself called upon by our relationship and my situation in life to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire         4.368816424913591
 be assured my dear sir that mrs         25.033338092263698
 collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family in your present distress which must be of the bitterest kind because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove         5.594575834942995
 no arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune or that may comfort you under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parents mind         5.871288694861684
 the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this         7.148433706491637
 and it is the more to be lamented because there is reason to suppose as my dear charlotte informs me that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence though at the same time for the consolation of yourself and mrs         4.011300620222732
 bennet i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad or she could not be guilty of such an enormity at so early an age         4.563418420543817
 howsoever that may be you are grievously to be pitied in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs         9.161301557092838
 collins but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter to whom i have related the affair         6.563519445894209
 i am dear sir c         71.78495400075452
 c         13118.875
 gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from colonel forster and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send         6.729278092543461
 it was not known that wickham had a single relation with whom he kept up any connection and it was certain that he had no near one living         4.358833867318349
 his former acquaintance had been numerous but since he had been in the militia it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them         6.157147792298205
 and in the wretched state of his own finances there was a very powerful motive for secrecy in addition to his fear of discovery by lydias relations for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount         4.3147084533095645
 he owed a good deal in the town but his debts of honour were still more formidable         8.341992020786083
 gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family jane heard them with horror         8.028725726190377
 a gamester         2776.8897888253273
 she cried         274.0995303024213
 this is wholly unexpected         140.29850453940736
 gardiner added in his letter that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day which was saturday         7.17735746147741
 when mrs         405.2158555880473
 bennet was told of this she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected considering what her anxiety for his life had been before         6.439155332084032
 what is he coming home and without poor lydia         13.16001329756046
 she cried         274.0995303024213
 sure he will not leave london before he has found them         13.133311019510879
 who is to fight wickham and make him marry her if he comes away         7.865480948605607
 as mrs         225.17065708446881
 gardiner began to wish to be at home it was settled that she and her children should go to london at the same time that mr         3.9620977797016312
 bennet came from it         109.4540817246142
 the coach therefore took them the first stage of their journey and brought its master back to longbourn         8.473896434074817
 his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece and the kind of halfexpectation which mrs         6.924270768570312
 gardiner had formed of their being followed by a letter from him had ended in nothing         8.178514993308534
 elizabeth had received none since her return that could come from pemberley         11.448241326210884
 the present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary nothing therefore could be fairly conjectured from that though elizabeth who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings was perfectly aware that had she known nothing of darcy she could have borne the dread of lydias infamy somewhat better         4.943083233035855
 it would have spared her she thought one sleepless night out of two         7.12595365644857
 when mr         247.44436301581914
 bennet arrived he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure         8.639422298417571
 he said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying made no mention of the business that had taken him away and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it         3.7979647197326902
 it was not till the afternoon when he joined them at tea that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject and then on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured he replied say nothing of that         4.252335481848657
 who should suffer but myself         105.28878269334824
 it has been my own doing and i ought to feel it         10.645950746691152
 you may well warn me against such an evil         16.373120568667478
 human nature is so prone to fall into it         32.42522700177095
 no lizzy let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame         9.907771347087527
 i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression         7.825432019084606
 it will pass away soon enough         44.61828815039202
 do you suppose them to be in london         13.812166881980371
 yes where else can they be so well concealed         26.588262366700807
 and lydia used to want to go to london added kitty         13.598110057638557
 she is happy then said her father drily and her residence there will probably be of some duration         7.569952367907564
 then after a short silence he continued lizzy i bear you no illwill for being justified in your advice to me last may which considering the event shews some greatness of mind         5.209192444801132
 they were interrupted by miss bennet who came to fetch her mothers tea         11.194010051086797
 this is a parade cried he which does one good it gives such an elegance to misfortune         7.160100044065309
 another day i will do the same i will sit in my library in my night cap and powdering gown and give as much trouble as i canor perhaps i may defer it till kitty runs away         5.679129245191048
 i am not going to run away papa said kitty fretfully if i should ever go to brighton i would behave better than lydia         6.5317475033636825
 you go to brighton         52.99096726340119
i would not trust you so near it as east bourne for fifty pounds         8.162273296355343
 no kitty i have at last learnt to be cautious and you will feel the effects of it         7.527466384005694
 no officer is ever to enter my house again nor even to pass through the village         8.890688563568082
 balls will be absolutely prohibited unless you stand up with one of your sisters         10.762602223055065
 and you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner         5.619500541806956
 well well said he do not make yourself unhappy         13.792229634649006
 if you are a good girl for the next ten years i will take you to a review at the end of them         5.107768382585042
 chapter vii         14675.902278985472
 two days after mr         216.7821786440135
 bennets return as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house they saw the housekeeper coming towards them and concluding that she came to call them to their mother went forward to meet her but instead of the expected summons when they approached her she said to miss bennet i beg your pardon madam for interrupting you but i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town so i took the liberty of coming to ask         4.148836591632678
 what do you mean hill         25.94751312346094
 we have heard nothing from town         44.99684908966844
 hill in great astonishment dont you know there is an express come for master from mr         10.042707229324675
 he has been here this half hour and master has had a letter         9.945218774108529
 away ran the girls too eager to get in to have time for speech         10.637294747853941
 they ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room from thence to the librarytheir father was in neither and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother when they were met by the butler who said if you are looking for my master maam he is walking towards the little copse         4.793295783951178
 upon this information they instantly passed through the hall once more and ran across the lawn after their father who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock         5.591732532028376
 jane who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as elizabeth soon lagged behind while her sister panting for breath came up with him and eagerly cried out oh papa what news         4.750498244600286
 what news         779.7929035907562
 yes i have had a letter from him by express         9.464814796411524
 well and what news does it bring         17.826624254114222
 good or bad         795.666356842291
 what is there of good to be expected         17.206668624346236
 said he taking the letter from his pocket but perhaps you would like to read it         8.629130357659353
 elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand         55.6179115948516
 read it aloud said their father for i hardly know myself what it is about         11.786767151555312
 gracechurchstreet monday august          19815.297227556635
 my dear brother at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece and such as upon the whole i hope will give you satisfaction         6.347363552137523
 soon after you left me on saturday i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of london they were         6.548134371634288
 the particulars i reserve till we meet         22.00438777329363
 it is enough to know they are discovered i have seen them both then it is as i always hoped cried jane they are married         6.258191885898114
 they are not married nor can i find there was any intention of being so but if you are willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on your side i hope it will not be long before they are         4.4252379159239545
 all that is required of you is to assure to your daughter by settlement her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister and moreover to enter into an engagement of allowing her during your life one hundred pounds per annum         4.680269980599867
 these are conditions which considering every thing i had no hesitation in complying with as far as i thought myself privileged for you         9.524451482819128
 you will easily comprehend from these particulars that mr         19.208693547730174
 wickhams circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be         14.222315371932249
 if as i conclude will be the case you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business i will immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper settlement         5.101199888166729
 there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again therefore stay quietly at longbourn and depend on my diligence and care         6.327409307023171
 send back your answer as soon as you can and be careful to write explicitly         8.552290554795665
 we have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house of which i hope you will approve         7.669363131338172
 she comes to us today         40.346251728085825
 i shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on         10.774699238695964
 is it possible         254.9365993667524
 cried elizabeth when she had finished         16.77180576996569
 can it be possible that he will marry her         13.600075893193718
 wickham is not so undeserving then as we have thought him said her sister         9.281178398469292
 my dear father i congratulate you         48.51888494591999
 and have you answered the letter         18.029629319563963
 said elizabeth         319.0614551513965
 no but it must be done soon         10.286291111945154
 my dear father she cried come back and write immediately         17.696256235873282
 consider how important every moment is in such a case         20.926841199173033
 let me write for you said jane if you dislike the trouble yourself         13.303274360879426
 i dislike it very much he replied but it must be done         7.980274533046222
 and so saying he turned back with them and walked towards the house         6.8315205180461485
 and may i ask         43.90337190361409
 said elizabeth but the terms i suppose must be complied with         11.410317591213925
 i am only ashamed of his asking so little         17.561159077475082
 and they must marry         54.44308358944408
 yet he is such a man         18.72983857555567
 yes yes they must marry         104.83386286753284
 there is nothing else to be done         25.948859672989887
 but there are two things that i want very much to knowone is how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about and the other how i am ever to pay him         5.438453817345002
 money         5523.736842105263
 my uncle         653.3187715015877
 cried jane what do you mean sir         20.639941134672757
 i mean that no man in his senses would marry lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred ayear during my life and fifty after i am gone         5.8447956532851935
 that is very true said elizabeth though it had not occurred to me before         7.5148828769833
 his debts to be discharged and something still to remain         12.963246511264789
 it must be my uncles doings         25.15161474171315
 generous good man i am afraid he has distressed himself         14.878082510956657
 a small sum could not do all this         35.191798465090585
 no said her father wickhams a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds         6.700958580297757
 i should be sorry to think so ill of him in the very beginning of our relationship         5.193944259156304
 ten thousand pounds         4178.663620436656
 heaven forbid         12160.184930968075
 how is half such a sum to be repaid         17.593701666825304
 and they are really to be married         17.19548691869466
 cried elizabeth as soon as they were by themselves         7.192066633704231
 how strange this is         216.93264874477177
 and for this we are to be thankful         9.884929130753221
 oh lydia         1668.3722666848648
 i comfort myself with thinking replied jane that he certainly would not marry lydia if he had not a real regard for her         6.29547944234776
 though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds or any thing like it has been advanced         7.415029781039534
 he has children of his own and may have more         16.06798028807965
 if we are ever able to learn what wickhams debts have been said elizabeth and how much is settled on his side on our sister we shall exactly know what mr         6.049286032064356
 gardiner has done for them because wickham has not sixpence of his own         13.233970359545111
 the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited         7.818350123051718
 their taking her home and affording her their personal protection and countenance is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge         6.26698476623656
 by this time she is actually with them         19.72821003631533
 if such goodness does not make her miserable now she will never deserve to be happy         10.576174933345273
 we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side said jane i hope and trust they will yet be happy         6.740125374777608
 their mutual affection will steady them and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly and live in so rational a manner as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten         6.5419297906624045
 their conduct has been such replied elizabeth as neither you nor i nor any body can ever forget         9.03150089435127
 it is useless to talk of it         31.067454115650943
 it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened         6.797198936235066
 they went to the library therefore and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it known to her         6.407859160282655
 may we take my uncles letter to read to her         17.285773560493098
 take whatever you like and get away         32.94120699103232
 elizabeth took the letter from his writing table and they went up stairs together         7.8729270005180885
 mary and kitty were both with mrs         31.297623241028734
 bennet one communication would therefore do for all         29.018894985032365
 after a slight preparation for good news the letter was read aloud         13.33529710657752
 bennet could hardly contain herself         79.12243619749827
 as soon as jane had read mr         19.935100780029803
 gardiners hope of lydias being soon married her joy burst forth and every following sentence added to its exuberance         8.21772485610053
 she was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation         6.611620477695722
 to know that her daughter would be married was enough         9.382736800319057
 she was disturbed by no fear for her felicity nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct         9.401442359968586
 my dear dear lydia         114.26159787948728
 she cried this is delightful indeed         30.660831067568566
she will be married         39.21215047690787
i shall see her again         44.14551631483335
she will be married at sixteen         18.18744837262925
my good kind brother         132.59215455891498
i knew how it would bei knew he would manage every thing         8.97656274405145
 and to see dear wickham too         18.639413762794423
 but the clothes the wedding clothes         32.4960323339391
 i will write to my sister gardiner about them directly         14.948986243223256
 lizzy my dear run down to your father and ask him how much he will give her         9.307335686896547
 ring the bell kitty for hill         95.26989965228879
 i will put on my things in a moment         17.824687676887056
 my dear dear lydia         114.26159787948728
how merry we shall be together when we meet         27.16539303894233
 gardiners behaviour laid them all under         110.3853418656674
 for we must attribute this happy conclusion she added in a great measure to his kindness         7.315058549269761
 we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist mr         16.270103607989743
 well cried her mother it is all very right who should do it but her own uncle         7.423648184794567
 if he had not had a family of his own i and my children must have had all his money you know and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him except a few presents         4.567963023853783
 well         564.252688172043
 i am so happy         61.68918578508777
 in a short time i shall have a daughter married         11.135702941295415
 how well it sounds         88.0304747889849
 and she was only sixteen last june         12.585302158859795
 my dear jane i am in such a flutter that i am sure i cant write so i will dictate and you write for me         4.82599026907229
 we will settle with your father about the money afterwards but the things should be ordered immediately         10.584590261739182
 she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico muslin and cambric and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders had not jane though with some difficulty persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted         4.575853129231255
 one days delay she observed would be of small importance and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual         8.573949116248956
 other schemes too came into her head         43.493839281993964
 i will go to meryton said she as soon as i am dressed and tell the good good news to my sister philips         4.850400300632165
 and as i come back i can call on lady lucas and mrs         7.161768987634228
 long         1039.118811881188
 kitty run down and order the carriage         53.157367758547146
 an airing would do me a great deal of good i am sure         7.057970374445255
 girls can i do any thing for you in meryton         15.473540962383568
 my dear hill have you heard the good news         27.169286932392094
 miss lydia is going to be married and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding         6.479849289293804
 hill began instantly to express her joy         60.281958541621584
 elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest and then sick of this folly took refuge in her own room that she might think with freedom         5.63531052466366
 poor lydias situation must at best be bad enough but that it was no worse she had need to be thankful         9.447120173208459
 she felt it so and though in looking forward neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister in looking back to what they had feared only two hours ago she felt all the advantages of what they had gained         4.589027346334334
 bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that instead of spending his whole income he had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of his children and of his wife if she survived him         5.186946278800729
 he now wished it more than ever         28.217955595713892
 the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place         4.900529916693851
 he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to any one should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brotherinlaw and he was determined if possible to find out the extent of his assistance and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could         4.01908497312718
 when first mr         305.6289460723249
 bennet had married economy was held to be perfectly useless for of course they were to have a son         7.9338060141198286
 this son was to join in cutting off the entail as soon as he should be of age and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for         5.375680615743653
 five daughters successively entered the world but yet the son was to come and mrs         17.600778951272535
 bennet for many years after lydias birth had been certain that he would         10.204561455237371
 bennet had no turn for economy and her husbands love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income         7.276725020419419
 five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs         30.700294535078754
 bennet and the children         30.84759611186236
 but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents         6.651029277528138
 this was one point with regard to lydia at least which was now to be settled and mr         7.163611523166957
 bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him         10.814016798034583
 in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother though expressed most concisely he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him         4.900876745441066
 he had never before supposed that could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement         4.848868593097417
 when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over he naturally returned to all his former indolence         6.369605637575528
 his letter was soon dispatched for though dilatory in undertaking business he was quick in its execution         7.601528285986841
 the good news quickly spread through the house and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood         9.155406486580963
 it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy         19.217726703870802
 to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had miss lydia bennet come upon the town or as the happiest alternative been secluded from the world in some distant farm house         4.181699860638867
 it was a fortnight since mrs         16.912976939737593
 bennet had been down stairs but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table and in spirits oppressively high         6.195716590681575
 no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph         14.543293217215359
 the marriage of a daughter which had been the first object of her wishes since jane was sixteen was now on the point of accomplishment and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials fine muslins new carriages and servants         4.162902206694116
 she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter and without knowing or considering what their income might be rejected many as deficient in size and importance         6.191961942820109
 i could not bear to have her ten miles from me and as for purvis lodge the attics are dreadful         6.009117967619964
 but when they had withdrawn he said to her mrs         10.38710856842604
 bennet before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter let us come to a right understanding         6.590303495823627
 into one house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance         15.45252238176043
 i will not encourage the impudence of either by receiving them at longbourn         8.754278236262898
 a long dispute followed this declaration but mr         32.19848838793952
 bennet was firm it soon led to another and mrs         19.109383710819543
 bennet found with amazement and horror that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter         7.384208712352867
 he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion         8.103370637920396
 bennet could hardly comprehend it         78.25366646860213
 that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid exceeded all that she could believe possible         5.659595208819696
 she was more alive to the disgrace which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughters nuptials than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham a fortnight before they took place         4.807411967741839
 elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had from the distress of the moment been led to make mr         6.297877395054078
 darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot         5.4321498204670196
 she had no fear of its spreading farther through his means         10.249063690005649
 not however from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself for at any rate there seemed a gulf impassable between them         6.282866432891295
 had lydias marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms it was not to be supposed that mr         5.2897428706184755
 darcy would connect himself with a family where to every other objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned         6.630801135032532
 from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink         9.72178666676711
 she was humbled she was grieved she repented though she hardly knew of what         10.88144223026674
 she became jealous of his esteem when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it         10.14227769377145
 she wanted to hear of him when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence         8.147501466751889
 she was convinced that she could have been happy with him when it was no longer likely they should meet         5.822115146449638
 what a triumph for him as she often thought could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now have been gladly and gratefully received         6.132203108781696
 he was as generous she doubted not as the most generous of his sex         7.272986859486818
 she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who in disposition and talents would most suit her         7.441100643637356
 his understanding and temper though unlike her own would have answered all her wishes         7.778910138930819
 an union of a different tendency and precluding the possibility of the other was soon to be formed in their family         7.66504907823865
 how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she could not imagine         7.5752739200393275
 but how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue she could easily conjecture         6.182798408233645
 gardiner soon wrote again to his brother         29.446842910266533
 to mr         75.9321085297702
 bennets acknowledgments he briefly replied with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again         6.549075461442878
 the principal purport of his letter was to inform them that mr         18.604638743994187
 wickham had resolved on quitting the militia         32.02095764890829
 it was greatly my wish that he should do so he added as soon as his marriage was fixed on         7.498249261717691
 and i think you will agree with me in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable both on his account and my nieces         5.823565330049708
 it is mr         123.16125908742279
 wickhams intention to go into the regulars and among his former friends there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army         5.99427783554752
 he has the promise of an ensigncy in general s regiment now quartered in the north         6.385608539228373
 it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom         7.952597074760572
 he promises fairly and i hope among different people where they may each have a character to preserve they will both be more prudent         9.212969312621174
 i have written to colonel forster to inform him of our present arrangements and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of mr         4.8950590958575475
 wickham in and near brighton with assurances of speedy payment for which i have pledged myself         6.980488091357048
 and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton of whom i shall subjoin a list according to his information         5.448194731384466
 he has given in all his debts i hope at least he has not deceived us         8.3428691487674
 haggerston has our directions and all will be completed in a week         19.042684730696738
 they will then join his regiment unless they are first invited to longbourn and i understand from mrs         8.085952072284428
 gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the south         8.159349663251295
 she is well and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother         8.50408684861835
yours c         6364.034881885458
 e         104951.0
 bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickhams removal from the shire as clearly as mr         5.934488721953368
 gardiner could do         467.3393662987826
 but mrs         253.28235779829197
 bennet was not so well pleased with it         15.046989767036786
 lydias being settled in the north just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire was a severe disappointment and besides it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body and had so many favourites         4.911008159295414
 she is so fond of mrs         21.319418297619745
 forster said she it will be quite shocking to send her away         8.88386440427308
 and there are several of the young men too that she likes very much         6.5950803865337875
 the officers may not be so pleasant in general s regiment         11.345106716644281
 his daughters request for such it might be considered of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the north received at first an absolute negative         6.815548585111767
 but jane and elizabeth who agreed in wishing for the sake of their sisters feelings and consequence that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly to receive her and her husband at longbourn as soon as they were married that he was prevailed on to think as they thought and act as they wished         3.451390878564853
 and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the north         4.837898597602278
 when mr         247.44436301581914
 bennet wrote again to his brother therefore he sent his permission for them to come and it was settled that as soon as the ceremony was over they should proceed to longbourn         4.845674089285834
 elizabeth was surprised however that wickham should consent to such a scheme and had she consulted only her own inclination any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes         5.464726305677163
 chapter ix         14675.902278985472
 their sisters wedding day arrived and jane and elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself         8.5275885560754
 the carriage was sent to meet them at and they were to return in it by dinnertime         7.387491566960919
 their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets and jane more especially who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself had she been the culprit was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure         4.982288055983663
 they came         434.97502787341807
 the family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive them         10.449380896537669
 smiles decked the face of mrs         98.28235932759533
 bennet as the carriage drove up to the door her husband looked impenetrably grave her daughters alarmed anxious uneasy         4.58096814165781
 lydias voice was heard in the vestibule the door was thrown open and she ran into the room         9.11049117435986
 her mother stepped forwards embraced her and welcomed her with rapture gave her hand with an affectionate smile to wickham who followed his lady and wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness         5.839310922963781
 their reception from mr         159.77398352521482
 the easy assurance of the young couple indeed was enough to provoke him         12.133752151217461
 elizabeth was disgusted and even miss bennet was shocked         21.19640345568711
 lydia was lydia still untamed unabashed wild noisy and fearless         14.473181088583218
 she turned from sister to sister demanding their congratulations and when at length they all sat down looked eagerly round the room took notice of some little alteration in it and observed with a laugh that it was a great while since she had been there         4.487598453146892
 wickham was not at all more distressed than herself but his manners were always so pleasing that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought his smiles and his easy address while he claimed their relationship would have delighted them all         5.042349633292477
 elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance but she sat down resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man         5.439168850355432
 she blushed and jane blushed but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour         7.14274702003174
 there was no want of discourse         27.075361720457085
 the bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough and wickham who happened to sit near elizabeth began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her replies         5.172347811336257
 they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world         11.898520032347747
 nothing of the past was recollected with pain and lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world         5.505026049066034
 only think of its being three months she cried since i went away it seems but a fortnight i declare and yet there have been things enough happened in the time         5.411199040797305
 when i went away i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came back again         5.32115198603771
 though i thought it would be very good fun if i was         7.828266019830708
 her father lifted up his eyes         80.51460504711862
 jane was distressed         498.2450805742971
 elizabeth looked expressively at lydia but she who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible gaily continued oh         7.249248739418658
 mamma do the people here abouts know i am married today         14.422897617651664
 i was afraid they might not and we overtook william goulding in his curricle so i was determined he should know it and so i let down the side glass next to him and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the window frame so that he might see the ring and then i bowed and smiled like any thing         4.6721424544139865
 elizabeth could bear it no longer         46.84882667911934
 she got up and ran out of the room and returned no more till she heard them passing through the hall to the diningparlour         6.065187514158448
 she then joined them soon enough to see lydia with anxious parade walk up to her mothers right hand and hear her say to her eldest sister ah         6.381569019474897
 jane i take your place now and you must go lower because i am a married woman         8.47163075725367
 it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first         3.9070493457882747
 her ease and good spirits increased         24.825955606057516
 she longed to see mrs         53.27134935307759
 philips the lucases and all their other neighbours and to hear herself called mrs         12.31328247404553
 wickham by each of them and in the mean time she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married to mrs         5.807100899841321
 hill and the two housemaids         37.17312033079081
 well mamma said she when they were all returned to the breakfast room and what do you think of my husband         5.707702763773845
 i am sure my sisters must all envy me         22.513930547526094
 i only hope they may have half my good luck         13.913820884442268
 they must all go to brighton         28.641045001334334
 that is the place to get husbands         13.322803947884909
 what a pity it is mamma we did not all go         15.011917747259083
 very true and if i had my will we should         10.888563556232667
 but my dear lydia i dont at all like your going such a way off         9.198652246131466
 must it be so         59.508815277004594
 yesthere is nothing in that         143.9692638473211
 i shall like it of all things         28.659832421237695
 you and papa and my sisters must come down and see us         11.349820923240118
 said her mother         310.3365367686446
 and then when you go away you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over         5.000629888564604
 i thank you for my share of the favour said elizabeth but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands         5.847867657222362
 wickham had received his commission before he left london and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight         5.487861260825454
 bennet regretted that their stay would be so short and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter and having very frequent parties at home         6.792090693388526
 these parties were acceptable to all to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think than such as did not         7.4374030041694885
 wickhams affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expected to find it not equal to lydias for him         7.829182620764841
 she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied from the reason of things that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather than by his and she would have wondered why without violently caring for her he chose to elope with her at all had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances and if that were the case he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion         4.204879519185411
 lydia was exceedingly fond of him         42.32348846012402
 he was her dear wickham on every occasion no one was to be put in competition with him         6.202563098397803
 he did every thing best in the world and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of september than any body else in the country         4.993058128010742
 one morning soon after their arrival as she was sitting with her two elder sisters she said to elizabeth lizzy i never gave you an account of my wedding i believe         5.381721635070035
 you were not by when i told mamma and the others all about it         7.934356668389287
 are not you curious to hear how it was managed         11.583362471566016
 no really replied elizabeth i think there cannot be too little said on the subject         10.19169376841594
 but i must tell you how it went off         13.406939434869088
 we were married you know at st         30.568412856830033
 clements because wickhams lodgings were in that parish         59.56191294480422
 and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven oclock         4.9291662334372655
 my uncle and aunt and i were to go together and the others were to meet us at the church         5.501622713926771
 well monday morning came and i was in such a fuss         18.88614452817169
 i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off and then i should have gone quite distracted         5.509700005142065
 i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat         10.293981371837209
 well and so we breakfasted at ten as usual i thought it would never be over for by the bye you are to understand that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them         4.0951564714327775
 to be sure london was rather thin but however the little theatre was open         9.7222539325966
 stone         104951.0
 and then you know when once they get together there is no end of it         7.733125242777689
 well i was so frightened i did not know what to do for my uncle was to give me away and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day         4.3236420533395
 but luckily he came back again in ten minutes time and then we all set out         9.43860995920275
 however i recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going the wedding need not be put off for mr         7.377516149085525
 darcy might have done as well         33.54369354309333
 repeated elizabeth in utter amazement         56.41996295406057
he was to come there with wickham you know         9.381693869919255
 but gracious me         577.9694520754614
 i ought not to have said a word about it         8.025909903707085
 it was to be such a secret         9.621791641470276
 if it was to be secret said jane say not another word on the subject         7.038293695572644
 you may depend upon my seeking no further         13.984524346685326
 certainly said elizabeth though burning with curiosity we will ask you no questions         11.227247123265096
 thank you said lydia for if you did i should certainly tell you all and then wickham would be angry         8.04661221972297
 on such encouragement to ask elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power by running away         5.648234409516334
 it was exactly a scene and exactly among people where he had apparently least to do and least temptation to go         6.989899959695634
 conjectures as to the meaning of it rapid and wild hurried into her brain but she was satisfied with none         6.369605924468463
 those that best pleased her as placing his conduct in the noblest light seemed most improbable         9.94212241859877
 she could not bear such suspense and hastily seizing a sheet of paper wrote a short letter to her aunt to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended         4.465286699074023
 you may readily comprehend she added what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us and comparatively speaking a stranger to our family should have been amongst you at such a time         5.347012899869826
 pray write instantly and let me understand itunless it is for very cogent reasons to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance         6.605551772033529
 not that i shall though she added to herself as she finished the letter and my dear aunt if you do not tell me in an honourable manner i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out         4.06343453603763
 janes delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall elizabeth was glad of ittill it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction she had rather be without a confidante         5.8844589430043905
 chapter x         14675.902278985472
 elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could         4.574312774831445
 she was no sooner in possession of it than hurrying into the little copse where she was least likely to be interrupted she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial         4.4853340401980235
 gracechurchstreet sept         40734.15062663163
 my dear niece i have just received your letter and shall devote this whole morning to answering it as i foresee that a little writing will not comprise what i have to tell you         5.731078367256351
 i must confess myself surprised by your application i did not expect it from you         8.502086093249126
 dont think me angry however for i only mean to let you know that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side         7.047229821153318
 if you do not choose to understand me forgive my impertinence         8.767475894292039
 but if you are really innocent and ignorant i must be more explicit         7.9606389526290595
 on the very day of my coming home from longbourn your uncle had a most unexpected visitor         5.634818319332324
 darcy called and was shut up with him several hours         12.760786930743025
 it was all over before i arrived so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as yours seems to have been         6.196940374533195
 he came to tell mr         30.24625378910625
 gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr         11.033797052609698
 from what i can collect he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them         6.099908608183332
 the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickhams worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him         5.757944177306745
 he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world         8.386266358580407
 his character was to speak for itself         20.209706795936665
 he called it therefore his duty to step forward and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself         5.2770527600804185
 if he had another motive i am sure it would never disgrace him         8.273425722188797
 there is a lady it seems a mrs         15.296623287840562
 younge who was some time ago governess to miss darcy and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation though he did not say what         6.924499597348562
 she then took a large house in edwardstreet and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings         9.155348265551785
 this mrs         335.3632318981173
 younge was he knew intimately acquainted with wickham and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town         5.722097350032959
 but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted         7.08260965922329
 she would not betray her trust i suppose without bribery and corruption for she really did know where her friend was to be found         5.963373552192439
 wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in london and had she been able to receive them into her house they would have taken up their abode with her         5.310468489615412
 they were in street         49.24473251918367
 he saw wickham and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia         18.378626379222553
 his first object with her he acknowledged had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her offering his assistance as far as it would go         4.53261858573344
 but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was         12.392347645558491
 she cared for none of her friends she wanted no help of his she would not hear of leaving wickham         6.284211957512292
 since such were her feelings it only remained he thought to secure and expedite a marriage which in his very first conversation with wickham he easily learnt had never been his design         5.978553662440947
 he meant to resign his commission immediately and as to his future situation he could conjecture very little about it         6.893450493780851
 he must go somewhere but he did not know where and he knew he should have nothing to live on         7.48775328737285
 darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once         12.114804161955863
 though mr         295.3035694792459
 bennet was not imagined to be very rich he would have been able to do something for him and his situation must have been benefited by marriage         5.779757328932674
 but he found in reply to this question that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country         6.27860715397875
 under such circumstances however he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief         8.921415865450303
 they met several times for there was much to be discussed         16.68961204309266
 wickham of course wanted more than he could get but at length was reduced to be reasonable         8.868656820996316
 every thing being settled between them mr         34.034382253634156
 darcys next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it and he first called in gracechurchstreet the evening before i came home         8.84123055220104
 gardiner could not be seen and mr         25.390211358488504
 darcy found on further enquiry that your father was still with him but would quit town the next morning         7.814780166487594
 he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former         5.2447456474125325
 he did not leave his name and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business         6.448006871758679
 on saturday he came again         57.583457468982346
 your father was gone your uncle at home and as i said before they had a great deal of talk together         6.0063908454097845
 they met again on sunday and then i saw him too         14.111279396310403
 it was not all settled before monday as soon as it was the express was sent off to longbourn         4.960092141498092
 i fancy lizzy that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all         11.02653663734041
 he has been accused of many faults at different times but this is the true one         8.31754629484917
 they battled it together for a long time which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved         8.577439986711592
 but at last your uncle was forced to yield and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it which went sorely against the grain and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers and give the praise where it was due         4.164464793279525
 but lizzy this must go no farther than yourself or jane at most         10.676340098028048
 you know pretty well i suppose what has been done for the young people         11.357637355451093
 the reason why all this was to be done by him alone was such as i have given above         7.615636358470511
 it was owing to him to his reserve and want of proper consideration that wickhams character had been so misunderstood and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was         5.52627412481237
 perhaps there was some truth in this though i doubt whether his reserve or anybodys reserve can be answerable for the event         6.90674320471172
 when all this was resolved on he returned again to his friends who were still staying at pemberley but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place and all money matters were then to receive the last finish         4.710744773101087
 i believe i have now told you every thing         10.073804411016669
 it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure         4.992671688464139
 lydia came to us and wickham had constant admission to the house         10.759311237958435
 he was exactly what he had been when i knew him in hertfordshire but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us if i had not perceived by janes letter last wednesday that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it and therefore what i now tell you can give you no fresh pain         4.2200799984114985
 if she heard me it was by good luck for i am sure she did not listen         7.354682991978488
 i was sometimes quite provoked but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane and for their sakes had patience with her         6.665309063785302
 darcy was punctual in his return and as lydia informed you attended the wedding         12.2562176901874
 he dined with us the next day and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday         7.748210315231665
 will you be very angry with me my dear lizzy if i take this opportunity of saying what i was never bold enough to say before how much i like him         5.004863725999271
 i thought him very slyhe hardly ever mentioned your name         12.592250685637802
 but slyness seems the fashion         224.1001020193946
 pray forgive me if i have been very presuming or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from p         7.367516955754028
 i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park         9.084429065459883
 a low phaeton with a nice little pair of ponies would be the very thing         14.028928073195667
 but i must write no more         24.865306047138585
 the children have been wanting me this half hour         14.708779695375398
 yours very sincerely m         405.67933982716534
 the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share         6.121825555063554
 the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr         10.916994926600298
 darcy might have been doing to forward her sisters match which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable and at the same time dreaded to be just from the pain of obligation were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true         4.441706209953735
 he had followed them purposely to town he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise and where he was reduced to meet frequently meet reason with persuade and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to avoid and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce         4.507111210081931
 he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem         7.789271094000003
 her heart did whisper that he had done it for her         11.065069665927258
 but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient when required to depend on his affection for her for a woman who had already refused him as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham         4.433885838768469
 brotherinlaw of wickham         891.633422528842
 every kind of pride must revolt from the connection         14.710185295317569
 he had to be sure done much         13.244734908195783
 she was ashamed to think how much         18.905755764357636
 but he had given a reason for his interference which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief         6.62996625376276
 it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong he had liberality and he had the means of exercising it and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement she could perhaps believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned         4.595895845128659
 it was painful exceedingly painful to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return         7.228363077242913
 they owed the restoration of lydia her character every thing to him         11.457510503276557
 how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him         8.218884316430804
 proud that in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better of himself         4.62827303496555
 she read over her aunts commendation of him again and again         13.954127214925895
 it was hardly enough but it pleased her         18.28132510376637
 she was even sensible of some pleasure though mixed with regret on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between mr         5.649123503929044
 darcy and herself         133.81128885316022
 she was roused from her seat and her reflections by some ones approach and before she could strike into another path she was overtaken by wickham         6.025069356778028
 i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble my dear sister         16.713027343075876
 said he as he joined her         22.69205753628278
 you certainly do she replied with a smile but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome         6.53518406895117
 i should be sorry indeed if it were         11.912600442617936
 we were always good friends and now we are better         15.374674539058892
 true         4198.04
 are the others coming out         48.058790569358074
 bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to meryton         12.13889387306628
 and so my dear sister i find from our uncle and aunt that you have actually seen pemberley         6.50191939322611
 she replied in the affirmative         29.762786720038342
 i almost envy you the pleasure and yet i believe it would be too much for me or else i could take it in my way to newcastle         6.408643565033299
 and you saw the old housekeeper i suppose         15.203632002022623
 poor reynolds she was always very fond of me         26.86296072255039
 but of course she did not mention my name to you         11.800485586954947
 yes she did         357.28856728323234
 and what did she say         34.540195441688276
 that you were gone into the army and she was afraid hadnot turned out well         6.854382708593827
 at such a distance as that you know things are strangely misrepresented         9.661612052778793
 certainly he replied biting his lips         40.33545431066122
 elizabeth hoped she had silenced him but he soon afterwards said i was surprised to see darcy in town last month         6.315921022708537
 we passed each other several times         57.40195527915522
 i wonder what he can be doing there         19.933644264097545
 perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh said elizabeth         13.755339944651954
 it must be something particular to take him there at this time of year         8.532274229590303
 did you see him while you were at lambton         16.802675978595293
 i thought i understood from the gardiners that you had         11.610072043923594
 yes he introduced us to his sister         40.12502458222076
 and do you like her         29.61772905588274
 very much         314.81985864210344
 i have heard indeed that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two         9.934160038612093
 when i last saw her she was not very promising         13.767294879908576
 i am very glad you liked her         13.869641728543039
 i hope she will turn out well         19.866802419306463
 i dare say she will she has got over the most trying age         11.007607804184406
 i mention it because it is the living which i ought to have had         7.87441176306802
excellent parsonage house         3001.0893669625075
 it would have suited me in every respect         12.68163399139705
 how should you have liked making sermons         23.121729289277187
 i should have considered it as part of my duty and the exertion would soon have been nothing         7.2640552961981255
 one ought not to repinebut to be sure it would have been such a thing for me         5.638369815916312
 the quiet the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness         6.901546884967213
 but it was not to be         5.562517397545763
 did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance when you were in kent         10.507038040606288
 you have         163.44732036306647
 yes there was something in that i told you so from the first you may remember         8.589958668890604
 i did hear too that there was a time when sermonmaking was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders and that the business had been compromised accordingly         5.296953496127175
 you did         199.09533792096573
 they were now almost at the door of the house for she had walked fast to get rid of him and unwilling for her sisters sake to provoke him she only said in reply with a goodhumoured smile come mr         4.198826681449781
 wickham we are brother and sister you know         22.459677437733294
 do not let us quarrel about the past         18.890085133058417
 in future i hope we shall be always of one mind         8.906312360391018
 wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again distressed himself or provoked his dear sister elizabeth by introducing the subject of it and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet         4.323024927516833
 the day of his and lydias departure soon came and mrs         9.28075249745745
 bennet was forced to submit to a separation which as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth         5.916547474101763
 my dear lydia she cried when shall we meet again         17.297500328905706
 i dont know         844.750046123266
 as often as i can         41.601055546175004
 but you know married women have never much time for writing         11.333340654460232
 my sisters may write to me         40.266672682050036
 they will have nothing else to do         13.7406388758626
 wickhams adieus were much more affectionate than his wifes         36.54470132346347
 he smiled looked handsome and said many pretty things         21.87851536945547
 he is as fine a fellow said mr         13.149132253970391
 bennet as soon as they were out of the house as ever i saw         3.3028425565103645
 he simpers and smirks and makes love to us all         17.04352375000942
 i am prodigiously proud of him         72.74992680010932
 i defy even sir william lucas himself to produce a more valuable soninlaw         12.45400749648616
 the loss of her daughter made mrs         20.083131169707812
 bennet very dull for several days         67.22382085396572
 i often think said she that there is nothing so bad as parting with ones friends         8.890689607756888
 one seems so forlorn without them         45.91921318032442
 this is the consequence you see madam of marrying a daughter said elizabeth         8.110243701224592
 it must make you better satisfied that your other four are single         11.383551657863315
 it is no such thing         34.8082050740651
 lydia does not leave me because she is married but only because her husbands regiment happens to be so far off         7.606684270722335
 if that had been nearer she would not have gone so soon         8.292674316055603
 but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope by an article of news which then began to be in circulation         6.10306378113348
 bennet was quite in the fidgets         32.50766042030988
 she looked at jane and smiled and shook her head by turns         10.302623051002083
 well well and so mr         37.83727489068066
 bingley is coming down sister for mrs         28.78880844877631
 philips first brought her the news         76.01790947821341
 well so much the better         27.42980624609409
 not that i care about it though         13.8996009290541
 he is nothing to us you know and i am sure i never want to see him again         3.7809374060372796
 but however he is very welcome to come to netherfield if he likes it         8.4951023912184
 and who knows what may happen         43.02293692912181
 but that is nothing to us         15.282284816591766
 you know sister we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it         9.247726307562754
 and so is it quite certain he is coming         10.916232509919924
 nicholls was in meryton last night i saw her passing by and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it and she told me that it was certain true         5.157123069024082
 he comes down on thursday at the latest very likely on wednesday         14.345285324964724
 she was going to the butchers she told me on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed         5.630159791012195
 miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour         11.147462401225285
 it was many months since she had mentioned his name to elizabeth but now as soon as they were alone together she said i saw you look at me today lizzy when my aunt told us of the present report and i know i appeared distressed         4.213794308871747
 i was only confused for the moment because i felt that i should be looked at         6.441407476814011
 i am glad of one thing that he comes alone because we shall see the less of him         8.512611501213375
 not that i am afraid of myself but i dread other peoples remarks         6.88343186476763
 elizabeth did not know what to make of it         7.817952622166947
 had she not seen him in derbyshire she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged but she still thought him partial to jane and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friends permission or being bold enough to come without it         4.461269986052927
 i will leave him to himself         34.87306036505419
 in spite of what her sister declared and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it         5.1443066597817255
 they were more disturbed more unequal than she had often seen them         10.608130522603345
 the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents about a twelvemonth ago was now brought forward again         7.118953271847951
 as soon as ever mr         27.705844716248752
 bingley comes my dear said mrs         38.20956688409743
 bennet you will wait on him of course         16.98020991260805
 no no         243.9504331030035
 you forced me into visiting him last year and promised if i went to see him he should marry one of my daughters         6.570792031836314
 but it ended in nothing and i will not be sent on a fools errand again         8.245489800423474
 his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen on his returning to netherfield         8.284026933903373
 tis an etiquette i despise said he         92.27067630644261
 if he wants our society let him seek it         21.783511324715448
 he knows where we live         90.2500009656406
 i will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again         6.6539887994594284
 well all i know is that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him         5.5380402716280175
 but however that shant prevent my asking him to dine here i am determined         8.364125528254956
 we must have mrs         103.82201785596943
 that will make thirteen with ourselves so there will be just room at table for him         8.502615247401128
 consoled by this resolution she was the better able to bear her husbands incivility though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see mr         6.520147394532302
 bingley in consequence of it before they did         20.930382508410514
 it would be nothing i could see him with perfect indifference but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of         6.165706649324018
 my mother means well but she does not know no one can know how much i suffer from what she says         7.70598343879626
 happy shall i be when his stay at netherfield is over         13.620063364533662
 i wish i could say any thing to comfort you replied elizabeth but it is wholly out of my power         4.649305330528314
 you must feel it and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me because you have always so much         6.564434685088232
 bingley arrived         1445.385649829437
 bennet through the assistance of servants contrived to have the earliest tidings of it that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could         4.847096434452422
 she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent hopeless of seeing him before         8.857523116635488
 but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire she saw him from her dressingroom window enter the paddock and ride towards the house         4.496412250035251
 her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy         13.000794202836765
 jane resolutely kept her place at the table but elizabeth to satisfy her mother went to the windowshe lookedshe saw mr         9.660818949388469
 darcy with him and sat down again by her sister         9.573956069086115
 there is a gentleman with him mamma said kitty who can it be         9.077401287082846
 some acquaintance or other my dear i suppose i am sure i do not know         6.17815681721166
 whats his name         2320.2959919602204
 that tall proud man         268.61978876942294
 well any friend of mr         67.12295711200872
 jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern         20.961831733018535
 she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter         5.312233396400005
 each felt for the other and of course for themselves and their mother talked on of her dislike of mr         7.750495074862445
 darcy and her resolution to be civil to him only as mr         6.873226985533089
 bingleys friend without being heard by either of them         22.96854656488237
 but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane to whom she had never yet had courage to shew mrs         5.6966478297647445
 gardiners letter or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him         14.881077386588768
 to jane he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused and whose merit she had undervalued but to her own more extensive information he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits and whom she regarded herself with an interest if not quite so tender at least as reasonable and just as what jane felt for bingley         4.456276677461653
 her astonishment at his comingat his coming to netherfield to longbourn and voluntarily seeking her again was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire         5.299551597770411
 the colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a minute with an additional glow and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken         5.044430259277373
 but she would not be secure         23.006251765107145
 let me first see how he behaves said she it will then be early enough for expectation         7.896671445875692
 she sat intently at work striving to be composed and without daring to lift up her eyes till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door         5.8297008636087595
 on the gentlemens appearing her colour increased yet she received them with tolerable ease and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance         6.434744029799882
 elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow and sat down again to her work with an eagerness which it did not often command         5.120092580544509
 she had ventured only one glance at darcy         23.35785329358653
 he looked serious as usual and she thought more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire than as she had seen him at pemberley         4.276946048673895
 but perhaps he could not in her mothers presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt         5.648308834095429
 it was a painful but not an improbable conjecture         10.367793419529
 bingley she had likewise seen for an instant and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed         6.667531766102053
 he was received by mrs         41.1205753065279
 bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend         5.143562626835049
 elizabeth particularly who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied         5.774006665011913
 darcy after enquiring of her how mr         42.38154625156052
 there he had talked to her friends when he could not to herself         8.92572208754991
 but now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice and when occasionally unable to resist the impulse of curiosity she raised her eyes to his face she as often found him looking at jane as at herself and frequently on no object but the ground         4.733011308871757
 more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please than when they last met were plainly expressed         10.508432739804864
 she was disappointed and angry with herself for being so         12.297373312865854
 could i expect it to be otherwise         25.883762378782713
 said she         174.60291386884307
 yet why did he come         98.04506558481916
 she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself and to him she had hardly courage to speak         4.768853964932157
 it is a long time mr         18.934567782216348
 bingley since you went away said mrs         18.507767350831873
 he readily agreed to it         102.46486165324357
 i began to be afraid you would never come back again         9.748151586948072
 people did say you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas but however i hope it is not true         8.634279191187321
 a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood since you went away         9.121093282995208
 miss lucas is married and settled         47.99476677854463
 and one of my own daughters         16.03648071893242
 i suppose you have heard of it indeed you must have seen it in the papers         6.32191350775408
 it was in the times and the courier i know though it was not put in as it ought to be         4.996812955454443
 it was only said lately george wickham esq         15.134093388097845
 it was my brother gardiners drawing up too and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it         5.199416025412547
 did you see it         103.41181730795991
 elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes         23.008794531852303
 how mr         287.25814605657246
 it is a delightful thing to be sure to have a daughter well married continued her mother but at the same time mr         4.576637738757544
 bingley it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me         6.340395006900903
 they are gone down to newcastle a place quite northward it seems and there they are to stay i do not know how long         5.570421011058858
 his regiment is there for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire and of his being gone into the regulars         5.164955853506545
 thank heaven         9166.798742175653
 he has some friends though perhaps not so many as he deserves         11.022489945318815
 elizabeth who knew this to be levelled at mr         19.369225743130414
 darcy was in such misery of shame that she could hardly keep her seat         6.560448849502968
 it drew from her however the exertion of speaking which nothing else had so effectually done before and she asked bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present         5.431465534706884
 a few weeks he believed         114.81982877818788
 when you have killed all your own birds mr         13.955089344091784
 bingley said her mother i beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on mr         5.856898635255258
 bennets manor         15918.487835252294
 i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you and will save all the best of the covies for you         7.258337831139101
 were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago every thing she was persuaded would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion         5.644451514016495
 at that instant she felt that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion         7.7114380521099815
 their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this         11.35425052884089
 let me never see either one or the other again         17.02907735182665
 yet the misery for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation received soon afterwards material relief from observing how much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her former lover         5.953147084596917
 he found her as handsome as she had been last year as good natured and as unaffected though not quite so chatty         6.040624502940559
 jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever         6.876067197970345
 when the gentlemen rose to go away mrs         20.879465223343633
 you are quite a visit in my debt mr         16.605401636509008
 bingley she added for when you went to town last winter you promised to take a family dinner with us as soon as you returned         5.2152873562701485
 i have not forgot you see and i assure you i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement         5.20943975340677
 bingley looked a little silly at this reflection and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business         6.804192076954279
 they then went away         148.42091033537702
 bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day but though she always kept a very good table she did not think any thing less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand ayear         4.746703296660054
 chapter xii         14675.902278985472
 as soon as they were gone elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits or in other words to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more         3.7735436060877374
 darcys behaviour astonished and vexed her         95.18527435931574
 why if he came only to be silent grave and indifferent said she did he come at all         8.11553487194198
 she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure         15.493293650136087
 he could be still amiable still pleasing to my uncle and aunt when he was in town and why not to me         5.440024047842826
 if he fears me why come hither         35.39583580273244
 if he no longer cares for me why silent         14.999411865179855
 teazing teazing man         3826.4750754842735
 i will think no more about him         22.373251217389445
 her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister who joined her with a cheerful look which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors than elizabeth         5.149660648439715
 now said she that this first meeting is over i feel perfectly easy         9.426014805484536
 i know my own strength and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming         7.738274249084856
 i am glad he dines here on tuesday         23.154150081435777
 it will then be publicly seen that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance         7.222894031950266
 yes very indifferent indeed said elizabeth laughingly         44.320617356089855
 oh jane take care         272.6958074298973
 my dear lizzy you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now         9.663306800989783
 i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever         5.481048066873601
 they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday and mrs         9.892610496955504
 bennet in the meanwhile was giving way to all the happy schemes which the good humour and common politeness of bingley in half an hours visit had revived         5.271326082111209
 on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn and the two who were most anxiously expected to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen were in very good time         5.736408673205071
 when they repaired to the diningroom elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place which in all their former parties had belonged to him by her sister         6.710479823914206
 her prudent mother occupied by the same ideas forbore to invite him to sit by herself         9.490048324577048
 on entering the room he seemed to hesitate but jane happened to look round and happened to smile it was decided         7.157349166235725
 elizabeth with a triumphant sensation looked towards his friend         11.254124785730735
 he bore it with noble indifference and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards mr         5.566803526964284
 his behaviour to her sister was such during dinner time as shewed an admiration of her which though more guarded than formerly persuaded elizabeth that if left wholly to himself janes happiness and his own would be speedily secured         5.131889033297024
 it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast for she was in no cheerful humour         6.246165074132895
 darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them         9.117787947604372
 he was on one side of her mother         9.568506262961472
 she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either or make either appear to advantage         8.304628264882428
 she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did         4.661397607435793
 her mothers ungraciousness made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeths mind and she would at times have given any thing to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family         5.306467999067468
 she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance         4.427039768906537
 she looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend         7.327476725878309
 the gentlemen came and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes but alas         6.408137747256654
 the ladies had crowded round the table where miss bennet was making tea and elizabeth pouring out the coffee in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair         4.962843422406105
 and on the gentlemens approaching one of the girls moved closer to her than ever and said in a whisper the men shant come and part us i am determined         4.865355505919819
 we want none of them do we         47.1482766688582
 darcy had walked away to another part of the room         15.600299063424854
 she followed him with her eyes envied every one to whom he spoke had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee and then was enraged against herself for being so silly         5.435284816070382
 a man who has once been refused         19.254694049587282
 how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love         7.118682318435964
 is there one among the sex who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman         6.583980334302198
 there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings         15.3746455149333
 she was a little revived however by his bringing back his coffee cup himself and she seized the opportunity of saying is your sister at pemberley still         5.020089359258558
 yes she will remain there till christmas         26.04851540701533
 and quite alone         379.7965680206752
 have all her friends left her         19.777376078554003
 annesley is with her         164.3342280000122
 the others have been gone on to scarborough these three weeks         11.437366640087658
 she could think of nothing more to say but if he wished to converse with her he might have better success         5.096278229685675
 he stood by her however for some minutes in silence and at last on the young ladys whispering to elizabeth again he walked away         6.656428794844831
 when the teathings were removed and the card tables placed the ladies all rose and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her mothers rapacity for whist players and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party         4.601700107199013
 she now lost every expectation of pleasure         28.124064322472275
 they were confined for the evening at different tables and she had nothing to hope but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself         5.630850000888031
 bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to supper but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others and she had no opportunity of detaining them         5.715930097386907
 well girls said she as soon as they were left to themselves what say you to the day         4.810990384017341
 i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well i assure you         11.160674285700459
 the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw         10.75894011212625
 the venison was roasted to a turnand everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch         9.687149250475251
 the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucass last week and even mr         8.095425290421797
 darcy acknowledged that the partridges were remarkably well done and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least         7.407083495921088
 and my dear jane i never saw you look in greater beauty         8.788642326190732
 long said so too for i asked her whether you did not         11.289527629019345
 and what do you think she said besides         7.027806371682113
 ah         20990.2
 bennet we shall have her at netherfield at last         19.22869733756126
 i do think mrs         94.26366807322943
 long is as good a creature as ever livedand her nieces are very pretty behaved girls and not at all handsome i like them prodigiously         5.825096202169263
 bennet in short was in very great spirits she had seen enough of bingleys behaviour to jane to be convinced that she would get him at last and her expectations of advantage to her family when in a happy humour were so far beyond reason that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day to make his proposals         4.730349745624246
 it has been a very agreeable day said miss bennet to elizabeth         10.800019577182981
 elizabeth smiled         906.5072526505229
 lizzy you must not do so         35.313887732661634
 it mortifies me         1106.5972075918319
 i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it         5.008479945049586
 it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man         5.534871381319743
 you are very cruel said her sister you will not let me smile and are provoking me to it every moment         6.7301477842026
 how hard it is in some cases to be believed         16.859620099565127
 and how impossible in others         54.601279333527245
 but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge         7.959342619319011
 that is a question which i hardly know how to answer         5.91980159704232
 we all love to instruct though we can teach only what is not worth knowing         10.086844295630593
 forgive me and if you persist in indifference do not make me your confidante         10.185881691243392
 a few days after this visit mr         40.19082778345304
 bingley called again and alone         76.2469126337132
 his friend had left him that morning for london but was to return home in ten days time         7.537821845453179
 he sat with them above an hour and was in remarkably good spirits         9.981189941754845
 bennet invited him to dine with them but with many expressions of concern he confessed himself engaged elsewhere         8.83152384075561
 next time you call said she i hope we shall be more lucky         8.877659849359485
 he should be particularly happy at any time c         13.876048693879543
 c         13118.875
 can you come tomorrow         112.03578392423958
 yes he had no engagement at all for tomorrow and her invitation was accepted with alacrity         8.37160535468725
 he came and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them dressed         7.312713797051125
 in ran mrs         459.06228719032646
 bennet to her daughters room in her dressing gown and with her hair half finished crying out my dear jane make haste and hurry down         5.534114885493212
 bingley is come         366.5247292006211
he is indeed         228.0501647488304
 make haste make haste         502.84794277239604
 here sarah come to miss bennet this moment and help her on with her gown         15.55868677491381
 never mind miss lizzys hair         81.62635519873945
 we will be down as soon as we can said jane but i dare say kitty is forwarder than either of us for she went up stairs half an hour ago         5.292077675143889
 hang kitty         10097.735766426538
 what has she to do with it         20.439501920488144
 come be quick be quick         110.11094826813721
 where is your sash my dear         36.57797830232845
 but when her mother was gone jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters         4.300953369351642
 the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening         12.105160800626914
 after tea mr         653.7019033380269
 two obstacles of the five being thus removed mrs         22.384057259773908
 bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time without making any impression on them         9.418408853216686
 elizabeth would not observe her and when at last kitty did she very innocently said what is the matter mamma         5.816543006054084
 what do you keep winking at me for         18.06481380771971
 what am i to do         26.499693674606036
 nothing child nothing         1078.224900603781
 i did not wink at you         24.30095424564951
 she then sat still five minutes longer but unable to waste such a precious occasion she suddenly got up and saying to kitty come here my love i want to speak to you took her out of the room         4.760980129320286
 jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation and her intreaty that she would not give into it         6.194736898910111
 in a few minutes mrs         32.02230820717652
 bennet half opened the door and called out lizzy my dear i want to speak with you         8.535554511593777
 elizabeth was forced to go         39.627995601445335
 we may as well leave them by themselves you know said her mother as soon as she was in the hall         4.971243857726806
 kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in my dressingroom         10.273862107908682
 elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother but remained quietly in the hall till she and kitty were out of sight then returned into the drawingroom         5.810179944425511
 bennets schemes for this day were ineffectual         40.608822354671666
 bingley was every thing that was charming except the professed lover of her daughter         8.895748783917197
 he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper and before he went away an engagement was formed chiefly through his own and mrs         8.482084564743282
 bennets means for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband         13.504475700675574
 after this day jane said no more of her indifference         16.38842102778537
 not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded unless mr         6.208257877909618
 darcy returned within the stated time         57.237645513103956
 bingley was punctual to his appointment and he and mr         16.937728759380107
 bennet spent the morning together as had been agreed on         14.147224949635474
 the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected         14.478291480514418
 there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley that could provoke his ridicule or disgust him into silence and he was more communicative and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him         5.571327431397699
 bingley of course returned with him to dinner and in the evening mrs         10.744553419281003
 bennets invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter         12.558404417065542
 elizabeth who had a letter to write went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea for as the others were all going to sit down to cards she could not be wanted to counteract her mothers schemes         4.428523845769606
 but on returning to the drawingroom when her letter was finished she saw to her infinite surprise there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her         5.691564630703255
 on opening the door she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth as if engaged in earnest conversation and had this led to no suspicion the faces of both as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other would have told it all         4.81107881957039
 their situation was awkward enough but hers she thought was still worse         11.458280832459101
 jane could have no reserves from elizabeth where confidence would give pleasure and instantly embracing her acknowledged with the liveliest emotion that she was the happiest creature in the world         4.9931969538090275
 she added by far too much         28.330213915376945
 why is not every body as happy         25.142348643965747
 elizabeths congratulations were given with a sincerity a warmth a delight which words could but poorly express         10.568936215681886
 every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane         10.659999192281587
 i must go instantly to my mother she cried         15.938926834376883
 i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude or allow her to hear it from any one but myself         6.198693759589062
 how shall i bear so much happiness         24.73787744413641
 elizabeth who was left by herself now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation         5.480261678240586
 and this said she is the end of all his friends anxious circumspection         7.5489065248415255
 of all his sisters falsehood and contrivance         14.353984051175214
 the happiest wisest most reasonable end         95.28904957723837
 in a few minutes she was joined by bingley whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose         5.423454876497079
 where is your sister         111.55052376191188
 said he hastily as he opened the door         21.702587202961162
 with my mother up stairs         51.652474192423874
 she will be down in a moment i dare say         11.432540248313938
 he then shut the door and coming up to her claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister         8.812903771030228
 elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship         8.579745204666203
 they shook hands with great cordiality and then till her sister came down she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness and of janes perfections and in spite of his being a lover elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded because they had for basis the excellent understanding and superexcellent disposition of jane and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself         4.621778889296439
 it was an evening of no common delight to them all the satisfaction of miss bennets mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face as made her look handsomer than ever         4.738903632682479
 kitty simpered and smiled and hoped her turn was coming soon         19.175789590322623
 bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings though she talked to bingley of nothing else for half an hour and when mr         4.59600573601989
 bennet joined them at supper his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was         9.582357080162744
 you will be a very happy woman         18.842388512725915
 jane went to him instantly kissed him and thanked him for his goodness         9.763110996626924
 you are a good girl he replied and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled         5.507161205273869
 i have not a doubt of your doing very well together         6.68833011996082
 your tempers are by no means unlike         53.20363883437204
 you are each of you so complying that nothing will ever be resolved on so easy that every servant will cheat you and so generous that you will always exceed your income         5.876676643763344
 i hope not so         76.8217009637505
 imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in me         26.29792634697911
 exceed their income         3317.54452377798
 my dear mr         306.2724779413878
 why he has four or five thousand ayear and very likely more         10.884946313862407
 then addressing her daughter oh         86.65212256402629
 my dear dear jane i am so happy         17.30656446454288
 i am sure i shant get a wink of sleep all night         10.385659879833248
 i knew how it would be         20.382566930601016
 i always said it must be so at last         11.462905828342635
 i remember as soon as ever i saw him when he first came into hertfordshire last year i thought how likely it was that you should come together         4.7901844135506995
 wickham lydia were all forgotten         63.18724006237631
 jane was beyond competition her favourite child         27.428931293399916
 her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense         7.292208654798728
 mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield and kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter         9.225279007711054
 bingley from this time was of course a daily visitor at longbourn coming frequently before breakfast and always remaining till after supper unless when some barbarous neighbour who could not be enough detested had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept         4.885059092126674
 elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister for while he was present jane had no attention to bestow on any one else but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur         5.0386166818598745
 in the absence of jane he always attached himself to elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her and when bingley was gone jane constantly sought the same means of relief         4.969495491098154
 he has made me so happy said she one evening by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring         5.736258998217147
 i had not believed it possible         20.03305947495946
 i suspected as much replied elizabeth         31.480415515545843
 it must have been his sisters doing         20.202824095099285
 they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me which i cannot wonder at since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects         6.420625906537552
 but when they see as i trust they will that their brother is happy with me they will learn to be contented and we shall be on good terms again though we can never be what we once were to each other         4.7338638780745885
 that is the most unforgiving speech said elizabeth that i ever heard you utter         7.27286873326109
 good girl         1224.155986802161
 it would vex me indeed to see you again the dupe of miss bingleys pretended regard         11.980033434755242
 would you believe it lizzy that when he went to town last november he really loved me and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again         5.479006687493471
 he made a little mistake to be sure but it is to the credit of his modesty         6.50999905375639
 this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence and the little value he put on his own good qualities         9.126718246146847
 elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend for though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him         3.945271272788984
 i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed         17.18601258766339
 if i could but see you as happy         16.87045937818269
 if there were but such another man for you         15.512579489799121
 if you were to give me forty such men i never could be so happy as you         7.716195546561891
 till i have your disposition your goodness i never can have your happiness         10.181938587566862
 no no let me shift for myself and perhaps if i have very good luck i may meet with another mr         7.434776088549481
 collins in time         240.36154782736259
 the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a secret         6.983492655092868
 bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs         27.452070072130528
 philips and she ventured without any permission to do the same by all her neighbours in meryton         7.467711120318539
 the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world though only a few weeks before when lydia had first run away they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune         5.364999104697942
 chapter xiv         14675.902278985472
 one morning about a week after bingleys engagement with jane had been formed as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the diningroom their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the sound of a carriage and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn         4.392583368252715
 the horses were post and neither the carriage nor the livery of the servant who preceded it were familiar to them         7.170632575598437
 as it was certain however that somebody was coming bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion and walk away with him into the shrubbery         5.1609507260770915
 it was lady catherine de bourgh         12.952166380109219
 they were of course all intending to be surprised but their astonishment was beyond their expectation and on the part of mrs         5.414289749216903
 she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious made no other reply to elizabeths salutation than a slight inclination of the head and sat down without saying a word         3.985382799887388
 elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyships entrance though no request of introduction had been made         7.596546166633383
 bennet all amazement though flattered by having a guest of such high importance received her with the utmost politeness         8.229853924913108
 elizabeth replied very concisely that she was         24.05974145560831
 and that i suppose is one of your sisters         7.72191559606301
 yes madam said mrs         224.85871998641878
 bennet delighted to speak to a lady catherine         18.583457001136193
 she is my youngest girl but one         16.906423845416032
 you have a very small park here returned lady catherine after a short silence         6.668257332941716
 this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening in summer the windows are full west         7.483028592886157
 bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner and then added may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr         6.108041299656305
 collins well         649.7200231149417
 yes very well         543.6145880881169
 i saw them the night before last         22.22818576645142
 elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from charlotte as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling         7.265152828219358
 but no letter appeared and she was completely puzzled         16.34211173716881
 bennet with great civility begged her ladyship to take some refreshment but lady catherine very resolutely and not very politely declined eating any thing and then rising up said to elizabeth miss bennet there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn         4.62142845439336
 go my dear cried her mother and shew her ladyship about the different walks         9.785992412278118
 i think she will be pleased with the hermitage         11.062257744774527
 elizabeth obeyed and running into her own room for her parasol attended her noble guest down stairs         8.208266857617133
 as they passed through the hall lady catherine opened the doors into the diningparlour and drawingroom and pronouncing them after a short survey to be decent looking rooms walked on         5.674730743850836
 her carriage remained at the door and elizabeth saw that her waitingwoman was in it         9.59423044486843
 how could i ever think her like her nephew         11.975707390419064
 as soon as they entered the copse lady catherine began in the following manner you can be at no loss miss bennet to understand the reason of my journey hither         4.109638515623612
 your own heart your own conscience must tell you why i come         14.611715186203021
 elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment         47.17016148231847
 indeed you are mistaken madam         54.3576657389783
 i have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here         5.361815652995337
 miss bennet replied her ladyship in an angry tone you ought to know that i am not to be trifled with         5.979823245170873
 but however insincere you may choose to be you shall not find me so         13.155275047387185
 my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness and in a cause of such moment as this i shall certainly not depart from it         5.756704982637068
 i was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married but that you that miss elizabeth bennet would in all likelihood be soon afterwards united to my nephew my own nephew mr         4.381647472557326
 though i know it must be a scandalous falsehood though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible i instantly resolved on setting off for this place that i might make my sentiments known to you         5.0121030205851715
 if you believed it impossible to be true said elizabeth colouring with astonishment and disdain i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far         6.755860786476359
 what could your ladyship propose by it         22.010262848650232
 at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted         11.055149477335124
 your coming to longbourn to see me and my family said elizabeth coolly will be rather a confirmation of it if indeed such a report is in existence         5.546343896356757
 if         346.37293729372936
 has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves         15.711051832362799
 i never heard that it was         38.80300621895567
 and can you likewise declare that there is no foundation for it         8.95397326118751
 i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship         7.311523966420463
 this is not to be borne         12.053925168850206
 miss bennet i insist on being satisfied         30.22796118513055
 has he has my nephew made you an offer of marriage         8.008859717099249
 your ladyship has declared it to be impossible         23.025094968823854
 it ought to be so it must be so while he retains the use of his reason         4.613446810918375
 but your arts and allurements may in a moment of infatuation have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family         7.335602847896353
 if i have i shall be the last person to confess it         9.931344330773712
 miss bennet do you know who i am         28.88607693106447
 i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns         6.884145453427017
 but you are not entitled to know mine nor will such behaviour as this ever induce me to be explicit         6.740502816144728
 let me be rightly understood         56.32140202163276
 this match to which you have the presumption to aspire can never take place         9.494641382980861
 no never         403.73431094062045
 now what have you to say         30.867382871988806
 only this that if he is so you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me         6.678179382180694
 lady catherine hesitated for a moment and then replied the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind         12.180113740591736
 from their infancy they have been intended for each other         21.796812615675698
 it was the favourite wish of his mother as well as of hers         6.3291754113168075
 while in their cradles we planned the union and now at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth of no importance in the world and wholly unallied to the family         4.478291296169305
 do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends         15.05886678814627
 to his tacit engagement with miss de bourgh         21.81506259294381
 are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy         14.971397406104382
 have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin         7.063387097164498
 yes and i had heard it before         18.086774374942532
 but what is that to me         24.985807770454983
 if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew i shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh         4.864318001934375
 you both did as much as you could in planning the marriage         9.634436211687296
 its completion depended on others         456.7000252448569
 if mr         260.19795513358326
 and if i am that choice why may not i accept him         8.614245287764254
 because honour decorum prudence nay interest forbid it         53.675352006972474
 yes miss bennet interest for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all         7.0208685318137425
 you will be censured slighted and despised by every one connected with him         9.032163217463813
 your alliance will be a disgrace your name will never even be mentioned by any of us         10.382287377884548
 these are heavy misfortunes replied elizabeth         84.31548256517665
 but the wife of mr         29.40487108091562
 darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation that she could upon the whole have no cause to repine         6.477199824637545
 obstinate headstrong girl         7953.185111325827
 i am ashamed of you         90.52616404085047
 is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring         11.050853777445687
 let us sit down         373.84219388297726
 you are to understand miss bennet that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose nor will i be dissuaded from it         5.28198492591316
 i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment         6.009632871689672
 that will make your ladyships situation at present more pitiable but it will have no effect on me         7.823666879180465
 i will not be interrupted         18.87313198826522
 hear me in silence         82.71848913082542
 my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other         12.170496767696571
 they are descended on the maternal side from the same noble line and on the fathers from respectable honourable and ancient though untitled families         7.842059376543583
 their fortune on both sides is splendid         25.470516597327688
 they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses and what is to divide them         7.184573449249235
 the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family connections or fortune         20.99305384996011
 is this to be endured         18.849287248821383
 but it must not shall not be         19.037871952814566
 if you were sensible of your own good you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up         5.245602836731037
 in marrying your nephew i should not consider myself as quitting that sphere         9.655164228032573
 he is a gentleman i am a gentlemans daughter so far we are equal         7.719982886291629
 true         4198.04
 you are a gentlemans daughter         30.228115965929135
 but who was your mother         32.488401562194944
 who are your uncles and aunts         32.229462174880496
 do not imagine me ignorant of their condition         25.954126009858424
 whatever my connections may be said elizabeth if your nephew does not object to them they can be nothing to you         7.820574051375505
 tell me once for all are you engaged to him         18.73043580645115
 though elizabeth would not for the mere purpose of obliging lady catherine have answered this question she could not but say after a moments deliberation i am not         5.78299259238909
 and will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement         8.599396402849646
 i will make no promise of the kind         17.77580464103748
 miss bennet i am shocked and astonished         29.63303890064694
 i expected to find a more reasonable young woman         12.75128097888771
 but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede         9.692490644270478
 i shall not go away till you have given me the assurance i require         8.12583272879615
 and i certainly never shall give it         19.254167267304098
 i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable         9.077670161658764
 your ladyship wants mr         404.31805583071974
 supposing him to be attached to me would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin         6.606928751512606
 you have widely mistaken my character if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these         8.999564018494144
 how far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs i cannot tell but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine         6.4332153831215955
 i must beg therefore to be importuned no farther on the subject         13.312008454874293
 i have by no means done         22.908115205847555
 to all the objections i have already urged i have still another to add         6.849720852399683
 i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sisters infamous elopement         10.51507184719014
 i know it all that the young mans marrying her was a patchedup business at the expence of your father and uncles         6.35882026188045
 and is such a girl to be my nephews sister         10.208297471741762
 is her husband is the son of his late fathers steward to be his brother         8.074485844186846
 heaven and earth         2964.340381025577
of what are you thinking         24.92994097911559
 you can now have nothing farther to say she resentfully answered         9.322870004953364
 you have insulted me in every possible method         36.67393581377143
 i must beg to return to the house         19.74647561272127
 and she rose as she spoke         34.389456685349664
 lady catherine rose also and they turned back         45.99859337893674
 her ladyship was highly incensed         53.204568580180094
 lady catherine i have nothing farther to say         16.705251933260058
 you know my sentiments         80.17810052493175
 you are then resolved to have him         23.487915877574416
 i have said no such thing         25.59360465277993
 it is well         190.8009148030044
 you refuse then to oblige me         49.19599761352473
 you refuse to obey the claims of duty honour and gratitude         11.349192872502305
 you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends and make him the contempt of the world         6.325362198032583
 neither duty nor honour nor gratitude replied elizabeth have any possible claim on me in the present instance         10.985365812942797
 no principle of either would be violated by my marriage with mr         12.137384601350403
 and this is your real opinion         20.599920430885113
 this is your final resolve         40.60514348894261
 i shall now know how to act         25.82007840126805
 do not imagine miss bennet that your ambition will ever be gratified         13.954084549663637
 i hoped to find you reasonable but depend upon it i will carry my point         7.1954427703540285
 in this manner lady catherine talked on till they were at the door of the carriage when turning hastily round she added i take no leave of you miss bennet         5.114787539749094
 i send no compliments to your mother         26.834301272157866
 you deserve no such attention         70.5577347341097
 i am most seriously displeased         63.30733805515617
 elizabeth made no answer and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house walked quietly into it herself         5.705811448549212
 she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs         10.087562364645374
 her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressingroom to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself         6.508006138864333
 she did not choose it said her daughter she would go         10.63414825423801
 she is a very finelooking woman         11.513770154891587
 and her calling here was prodigiously civil         21.426816567920316
 for she only came i suppose to tell us the collinses were well         9.035951204734094
 she is on her road somewhere i dare say and so passing through meryton thought she might as well call on you         6.101585943621078
 elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible         6.865551018228984
 the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into could not be easily overcome nor could she for many hours learn to think of it less than incessantly         5.494364995789032
 it was a rational scheme to be sure         11.518168173642064
 but from what the report of their engagement could originate elizabeth was at a loss to imagine till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley and her being the sister of jane was enough at a time when the expectation of one wedding made every body eager for another to supply the idea         4.51547806207949
 she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together         6.4914065860519745
 and her neighbours at lucas lodge therefore for through their communication with the collinses the report she concluded had reached lady catherine had only set that down as almost certain and immediate which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time         5.124347929263681
 in revolving lady catherines expressions however she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference         6.505520641309516
 she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt or his dependence on her judgment but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do and it was certain that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own his aunt would address him on his weakest side         4.253000888793254
 if he had been wavering before as to what he should do which had often seemed likely the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him         4.5198924756343395
 in that case he would return no more         18.31472724971018
 lady catherine might see him in her way through town and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way         7.872099554044351
 if therefore an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days she added i shall know how to understand it         6.450961115539476
 i shall then give over every expectation every wish of his constancy         12.159621954246361
 if he is satisfied with only regretting me when he might have obtained my affections and hand i shall soon cease to regret him at all         6.077526241908459
 the surprise of the rest of the family on hearing who their visitor had been was very great but they obligingly satisfied it with the same kind of supposition which had appeased mrs         4.472442946986846
 bennets curiosity and elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject         12.88980675154209
 the next morning as she was going down stairs she was met by her father who came out of his library with a letter in his hand         5.770117080621082
 lizzy said he i was going to look for you come into my room         9.732250940376838
 she followed him thither and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held         5.378923370234352
 it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations         8.075834025784065
 i did not know before that i had two daughters on the brink of matrimony         5.272236091948298
 let me congratulate you on a very important conquest         28.601531370817536
 the colour now rushed into elizabeths cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew instead of the aunt and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself when her father continued you look conscious         4.754612909464147
 young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these but i think i may defy even your sagacity to discover the name of your admirer         6.200852765951762
 this letter is from mr         52.64811727662086
 collins         760.5144927536231
 collins         760.5144927536231
 i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says on that point         8.627937224751697
 what relates to yourself is as follows         28.811926917619154
 having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs         30.251895756752308
 can you possibly guess lizzy who is meant by this         18.5487671489744
 yet in spite of all these temptations let me warn my cousin elizabeth and yourself of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentlemans proposals which of course you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of         5.321868460788779
 have you any idea lizzy who this gentleman is         12.963676456633296
 but now it comes out         35.991346544130856
 we have reason to imagine that his aunt lady catherine de bourgh does not look on the match with a friendly eye         6.408284315360675
 darcy you see is the man         31.818440563707014
 now lizzy i think i have surprised you         14.011499928335217
 could he or the lucases have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related         5.69505016065646
 it is admirable         815.4129258264368
 elizabeth tried to join in her fathers pleasantry but could only force one most reluctant smile         8.75068596896942
 never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her         6.748884005860002
 are you not diverted         59.40517171690216
 yes         1943.5370370370372
 after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night she immediately with her usual condescension expressed what she felt on the occasion when it became apparent that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match         4.365953766991527
 i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned         4.437783507168933
 collins moreover adds i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydias sad business has been so well hushed up and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known         6.795184911626675
 i must not however neglect the duties of my station or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married         3.828260066510614
 it was an encouragement of vice and had i been the rector of longbourn i should very strenuously have opposed it         6.2090911241477365
 you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian but never to admit them in your sight or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing         6.751499698321518
 that is his notion of christian forgiveness         15.613249246947392
 but lizzy you look as if you did not enjoy it         6.499407337568088
 you are not going to be missish i hope and pretend to be affronted at an idle report         5.959705975337626
 for what do we live but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our turn         7.319215621050341
 cried elizabeth i am excessively diverted         25.23813987383367
 but it is so strange         30.97494648470059
 yesthat is what makes it amusing         68.92147614144169
 had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing but his perfect indifference and your pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd         6.067817975634359
 collinss correspondence for any consideration         122.81821270059821
 nay when i read a letter of his i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my soninlaw         6.311869080857828
 and pray lizzy what said lady catherine about this report         17.581540302648815
 did she call to refuse her consent         28.637857454707156
 to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh and as it had been asked without the least suspicion she was not distressed by his repeating it         5.896542667393946
 elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not         6.6320927880620015
 it was necessary to laugh when she would rather have cried         10.650297356717433
 her father had most cruelly mortified her by what he said of mr         8.551154472052025
 darcys indifference and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration or fear that perhaps instead of his seeing too little she might have fancied too much         6.233883197419536
 instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend as elizabeth half expected mr         10.757510221910287
 bingley to do he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherines visit         6.007013823677927
 the gentlemen arrived early and before mrs         35.72799588476631
 bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt of which her daughter sat in momentary dread bingley who wanted to be alone with jane proposed their all walking out         5.705090551431249
 they lagged behind while elizabeth kitty and darcy were to entertain each other         17.270772825141435
 very little was said by either kitty was too much afraid of him to talk elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution and perhaps he might be doing the same         5.681776205829132
 they walked towards the lucases because kitty wished to call upon maria and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern when kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone         5.7717955270217525
 now was the moment for her resolution to be executed and while her courage was high she immediately said mr         5.648599600217955
 darcy i am a very selfish creature and for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings care not how much i may be wounding yours         5.385855540206847
 i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister         7.675122600965217
 ever since i have known it i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it         7.45506327959501
 were it known to the rest of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to express         5.813426188668263
 i am sorry exceedingly sorry replied darcy in a tone of surprise and emotion that you have ever been informed of what may in a mistaken light have given you uneasiness         6.111010262329332
 i did not think mrs         21.219413530310177
 gardiner was so little to be trusted         21.502446583653615
 you must not blame my aunt         25.126229193904386
 lydias thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter and of course i could not rest till i knew the particulars         7.2250337375562985
 let me thank you again and again in the name of all my family for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble and bear so many mortifications for the sake of discovering them         4.743979919211996
 if you will thank me he replied let it be for yourself alone         9.936448260346241
 but your family owe me nothing         32.34677533852051
 elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word         14.158195571038922
 if your feelings are still what they were last april tell me so at once         9.968849131544095
 my affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever         8.252931689680782
 elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation now forced herself to speak and immediately though not very fluently gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change since the period to which he alluded as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances         4.656362511042687
 the happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never felt before and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do         4.98165332607063
 had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt delight diffused over his face became him but though she could not look she could listen and he told her of feelings which in proving of what importance she was to him made his affection every moment more valuable         4.580845477450513
 they walked on without knowing in what direction         20.433104519267648
 she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt who did call on him in her return through london and there relate her journey to longbourn its motive and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which in her ladyships apprehension peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which she had refused to give         4.360428467133555
 but unluckily for her ladyship its effect had been exactly contrariwise         15.235167153222308
 it taught me to hope said he as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before         8.794234230355368
 i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that had you been absolutely irrevocably decided against me you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly         5.88667698389723
 elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied yes you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that         7.7282265208014795
 after abusing you so abominably to your face i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations         8.593698636884127
 what did you say of me that i did not deserve         11.353309177584112
 for though your accusations were illfounded formed on mistaken premises my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof         6.559842690530855
 i cannot think of it without abhorrence         26.37212470396437
 we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening said elizabeth         8.356406323963414
 i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself         17.181427653659505
 the recollection of what i then said of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of it is now and has been many months inexpressibly painful to me         5.352441918522875
 your reproof so well applied i shall never forget had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner         5.307588866640944
 those were your words         116.69254647799106
 you know not you can scarcely conceive how they have tortured methough it was some time i confess before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice         5.513384601078607
 i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression         8.941860385074312
 i can easily believe it         50.58605090292886
 you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling i am sure you did         7.643236576775228
 the turn of your countenance i shall never forget as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me         3.9920416239698397
 these recollections will not do at all         46.94085885689469
 i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it         6.382604908376872
 darcy mentioned his letter         112.9386930029668
 did you on reading it give any credit to its contents         10.667004792088807
 she explained what its effect on her had been and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed         8.048279315624608
 i hope you have destroyed the letter         20.21095966135055
 there was one part especially the opening of it which i should dread your having the power of reading again         6.976707279453997
 the letter shall certainly be burnt if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard but though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable they are not i hope quite so easily changed as that implies         4.86152036439301
 when i wrote that letter replied darcy i believed myself perfectly calm and cool but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit         6.397643492229698
 the letter perhaps began in bitterness but it did not end so         11.665628099988545
 the adieu is charity itself         58.19456320136515
 but think no more of the letter         15.24845686310031
 the feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten         4.535515419521612
 you must learn some of my philosophy         33.67475038824276
 think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure         11.126637105037311
 i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind         13.415938206155092
 your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy but what is much better of ignorance         7.77497153689388
 but with me it is not so         13.425607725573196
 painful recollections will intrude which cannot which ought not to be repelled         15.537155814046354
 i have been a selfish being all my life in practice though not in principle         7.620022593972904
 as a child i was taught what was right but i was not taught to correct my temper         7.4180190479299455
 i was given good principles but left to follow them in pride and conceit         8.865526630061709
 unfortunately an only son for many years an only child i was spoilt by my parents who though good themselves my father particularly all that was benevolent and amiable allowed encouraged almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing to care for none beyond my own family circle to think meanly of all the rest of the world to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own         4.440811792816632
 you taught me a lesson hard indeed at first but most advantageous         12.717265250967465
 by you i was properly humbled         19.842806277956665
 i came to you without a doubt of my reception         8.740459325354747
 you shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased         8.823238312598342
 had you then persuaded yourself that i should         16.37837100519203
 indeed i had         198.9583616299121
 what will you think of my vanity         15.848285585122596
 i believed you to be wishing expecting my addresses         14.52590064151357
 my manners must have been in fault but not intentionally i assure you         10.12148901817192
 i never meant to deceive you but my spirits might often lead me wrong         10.99938165712052
 how you must have hated me after that evening         15.173588002577487
 hate you         995.6091314124301
 i was angry perhaps at first but my anger soon began to take a proper direction         8.54569502842326
 i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at pemberley         9.686975140404721
 you blamed me for coming         116.6495750709951
 no indeed i felt nothing but surprise         20.835054766498704
 your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you         11.518502882542357
 how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you         6.829709204782749
 he then told her of georgianas delight in her acquaintance and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend         4.448636484946916
 she expressed her gratitude again but it was too painful a subject to each to be dwelt on farther         6.994200990554124
 after walking several miles in a leisurely manner and too busy to know any thing about it they found at last on examining their watches that it was time to be at home         6.312746278998713
 what could become of mr         91.03316232052818
 bingley and jane         167.86781471393206
 was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs         12.760304911513822
 darcy was delighted with their engagement his friend had given him the earliest information of it         9.087995478309796
 said elizabeth         319.0614551513965
 not at all         117.89230474173048
 when i went away i felt that it would soon happen         9.713006262075773
 that is to say you had given your permission         10.205147180895638
 i guessed as much         135.0885896859445
 and though he exclaimed at the term she found that it had been pretty much the case         6.000134268693143
 on the evening before my going to london said he i made a confession to him which i believe i ought to have made long ago         4.868948679446558
 i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent         5.378042821508938
 his surprise was great         78.58919974591
 he had never had the slightest suspicion         20.469744809387777
 i told him moreover that i believed myself mistaken in supposing as i had done that your sister was indifferent to him and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated i felt no doubt of their happiness together         4.373532406951575
 elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend         7.732120657371667
 did you speak from your own observation said she when you told him that my sister loved him or merely from my information last spring         6.811425995795073
 from the former         289.7416670096983
 and your assurance of it i suppose carried immediate conviction to him         11.247309241757593
 it did         191.69945040836146
 bingley is most unaffectedly modest         54.117356660701894
 his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case but his reliance on mine made every thing easy         6.968757870262401
 i was obliged to confess one thing which for a time and not unjustly offended him         8.32067211171821
 i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter that i had known it and purposely kept it from him         5.237991436787059
 he was angry         289.5522630398295
 but his anger i am persuaded lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sisters sentiments         8.011510228022681
 he has heartily forgiven me now         49.6875487101061
 elizabeth longed to observe that mr         39.14368960330358
 she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at and it was rather too early to begin         5.906640056826663
 in anticipating the happiness of bingley which of course was to be inferior only to his own he continued the conversation till they reached the house         6.338705085795636
 in the hall they parted         56.729252256934735
 chapter xvii         14675.902278985472
 she had only to say in reply that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own knowledge         6.18921915634331
 the evening passed quietly unmarked by any thing extraordinary         18.557601393594698
 the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed the unacknowledged were silent         20.698793699012164
 darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth and elizabeth agitated and confused rather knew that she was happy than felt herself to be so for besides the immediate embarrassment there were other evils before her         4.811684400891756
 she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known she was aware that no one liked him but jane and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away         5.171806415088497
 at night she opened her heart to jane         19.62078801294729
 though suspicion was very far from miss bennets general habits she was absolutely incredulous here         9.28806879076343
engaged to mr         214.2603903331872
 no no you shall not deceive me         18.831915280187896
 i know it to be impossible         11.347311984011537
 this is a wretched beginning indeed         22.17427113366643
 my sole dependence was on you and i am sure nobody else will believe me if you do not         7.212353537678937
 yet indeed i am in earnest         36.507729807379974
 i speak nothing but the truth         37.404292985402385
 he still loves me and we are engaged         34.16844088998407
 jane looked at her doubtingly         58.64317891783012
 it cannot be         244.67356046239294
 i know how much you dislike him         25.607619998063573
 you know nothing of the matter         27.80961398067134
 that is all to be forgot         22.222712944111215
 perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now         8.637737479437988
 but in such cases as these a good memory is unpardonable         8.362785394798928
 this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself         9.365109023954899
 good heaven         2676.4117524601447
 yet now i must believe you cried jane         20.020783768327945
 my dear dear lizzy i wouldi do congratulate youbut are you certain         13.812099169064016
 forgive the questionare you quite certain that you can be happy with him         18.518834414019032
 there can be no doubt of that         19.506022290431506
 it is settled between us already that we are to be the happiest couple in the world         7.4539253319230925
 but are you pleased jane         34.367110014500824
 very very much         238.9296201117059
 and do you really love him quite well enough         10.209323282356925
 do any thing rather than marry without affection         18.590184452514375
 are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do         9.927587470647357
 you will only think i feel more than i ought to do when i tell you all         6.623728447338494
 what do you mean         41.41469075816906
 why i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley         8.147304105466318
 i am afraid you will be angry         21.040837488500717
 my dearest sister now be be serious         41.504547827253
 i want to talk very seriously         23.85018569954231
 let me know every thing that i am to know without delay         13.369975928136943
 will you tell me how long you have loved him         14.675712496502006
 it has been coming on so gradually that i hardly know when it began         9.368530825529128
 but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at pemberley         8.516459803190338
 another intreaty that she would be serious however produced the desired effect and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment         7.365578542564478
 when convinced on that article miss bennet had nothing farther to wish         12.118056116573982
 now i am quite happy said she for you will be as happy as myself         7.387632222624287
 i always had a value for him         19.040584037200063
 were it for nothing but his love of you i must always have esteemed him but now as bingleys friend and your husband there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me         5.109631802222602
 but lizzy you have been very sly very reserved with me         11.657141331822174
 how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton         11.443914099597993
 i owe all that i know of it to another not to you         11.44103514470217
 elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy         16.62197325590344
 she had been unwilling to mention bingley and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend         5.907774707885725
 all was acknowledged and half the night spent in conversation         14.491483722632903
 good gracious         2704.7882592003716
 bennet as she stood at a window the next morning if that disagreeable mr         8.023868464761005
 darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley         12.34340303335711
 what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here         7.3712765482146425
 i had no notion but he would go a shooting or something or other and not disturb us with his company         6.396033603996931
 what shall we do with him         41.68358167817456
 lizzy you must walk out with him again that he may not be in bingleys way         7.280138142150166
 elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet         5.73696271413478
 as soon as they entered bingley looked at her so expressively and shook hands with such warmth as left no doubt of his good information and he soon afterwards said aloud mr         4.43673256113001
 bennet have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again today         8.040718314594052
 i advise mr         381.379470534736
 darcy and lizzy and kitty said mrs         20.855013382418957
 bennet to walk to oakham mount this morning         18.111928074771626
 it is a nice long walk and mr         12.57738724756477
 darcy has never seen the view         39.550096880424235
 bingley but i am sure it will be too much for kitty         6.09963047388526
 wont it kitty         1784.8672040230247
 kitty owned that she had rather stay at home         26.408610643898843
 darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount and elizabeth silently consented         8.848911075614343
 as she went up stairs to get ready mrs         12.543339078477299
 but i hope you will not mind it it is all for janes sake you know and there is no occasion for talking to him except just now and then         4.0942201628473605
 so do not put yourself to inconvenience         20.697881895051985
 during their walk it was resolved that mr         31.457686123960993
 bennets consent should be asked in the course of the evening         8.604028684477493
 she could not determine how her mother would take it sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man         5.297950021137744
 but whether she were violently set against the match or violently delighted with it it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense and she could no more bear that mr         4.714204467055926
 darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy than the first vehemence of her disapprobation         9.584462975887808
 bennet withdrew to the library she saw mr         22.328054004232936
 darcy rise also and follow him and her agitation on seeing it was extreme         14.96857810186047
 she did not fear her fathers opposition but he was going to be made unhappy and that it should be through her means that she his favourite child should be distressing him by her choice should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her was a wretched reflection and she sat in misery till mr         4.396350760573765
 darcy appeared again when looking at him she was a little relieved by his smile         9.488532038708097
 she was gone directly         76.91079807156511
 her father was walking about the room looking grave and anxious         10.862620148007787
 lizzy said he what are you doing         24.775830271351293
 have not you always hated him         22.26675738203157
 how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable her expressions more moderate         9.51616893216763
 it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give but they were now necessary and she assured him with some confusion of her attachment to mr         4.847514096545169
 or in other words you are determined to have him         9.41182770467048
 but will they make you happy         26.75979221708768
 none at all         454.63759938011424
 we all know him to be a proud unpleasant sort of man but this would be nothing if you really liked him         6.717155248305238
 i do i do like him she replied with tears in her eyes i love him         6.190656617061307
 indeed he has no improper pride         36.99170543679752
 he is perfectly amiable         99.98742596992635
 you do not know what he really is then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms         5.131253768980435
 lizzy said her father i have given him my consent         11.293716730223595
 he is the kind of man indeed to whom i should never dare refuse any thing which he condescended to ask         5.859138495109969
 i now give it to you if you are resolved on having him         10.217794152469255
 but let me advise you to think better of it         14.063762209703597
 i know your disposition lizzy         45.759837578837946
 i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable unless you truly esteemed your husband unless you looked up to him as a superior         6.075512921960342
 your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage         15.04959720638096
 you could scarcely escape discredit and misery         26.94499088389889
 my child let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life         9.38241270376587
 you know not what you are about         21.531170055730204
 elizabeth still more affected was earnest and solemn in her reply and at length by repeated assurances that mr         7.712070898524212
 darcy was really the object of her choice by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day but had stood the test of many months suspense and enumerating with energy all his good qualities she did conquer her fathers incredulity and reconcile him to the match         4.4364582561035775
 well my dear said he when she ceased speaking i have no more to say         6.445180479328165
 if this be the case he deserves you         17.36773396973352
 i could not have parted with you my lizzy to any one less worthy         6.818424650645831
 to complete the favourable impression she then told him what mr         10.511402558595318
 darcy had voluntarily done for lydia         52.10295538244762
 he heard her with astonishment         37.87162164551073
 this is an evening of wonders indeed         21.035151782637133
 and so darcy did every thing made up the match gave the money paid the fellows debts and got him his commission         6.254963423363089
 so much the better         24.882579178625484
 it will save me a world of trouble and economy         19.659082341507645
 had it been your uncles doing i must and would have paid him but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way         6.084061421251152
 i shall offer to pay him tomorrow he will rant and storm about his love for you and there will be an end of the matter         6.880434767499276
 elizabeths mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight and after half an hours quiet reflection in her own room she was able to join the others with tolerable composure         5.911241904431293
 every thing was too recent for gaiety but the evening passed tranquilly away there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time         5.62502261757239
 when her mother went up to her dressingroom at night she followed her and made the important communication         7.87945352366056
 its effect was most extraordinary for on first hearing it mrs         15.330668189801054
 bennet sat quite still and unable to utter a syllable         19.476739701726608
 nor was it under many many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them         4.7201136575511455
 she began at length to recover to fidget about in her chair get up sit down again wonder and bless herself         6.761974364947966
 lord bless me         2863.2170437716886
 only think         590.7236793577155
 dear me         423.8201248741072
 who would have thought it         30.047317845739077
 my sweetest lizzy         1472.6586256407643
 how rich and how great you will be         21.24413400755931
 what pinmoney what jewels what carriages you will have         29.385687486704917
 janes is nothing to itnothing at all         32.410679375707495
 i am so pleasedso happy         49.20350132844944
 such a charming man         128.0643992282278
so handsome         608.597686395612
 so tall         1191.3286059187549
 pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before         24.497299287042726
 i hope he will overlook it         20.60804577648537
 dear dear lizzy         1010.6468456411146
 a house in town         38.24048953497657
 every thing that is charming         51.2127121105112
 ten thousand a year         150.6162343890299
 what will become of me         94.121679372186
 i shall go distracted         130.58068121956137
 this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted and elizabeth rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself soon went away         6.0133533298497435
 but before she had been three minutes in her own room her mother followed her         6.686210758471724
 my dearest child she cried i can think of nothing else         18.303046185375305
 tis as good as a lord         62.314968422061455
 and a special licence         146.24639479410735
 you must and shall be married by a special licence         10.187688113973625
 but my dearest love tell me what dish mr         20.487990774281123
 darcy is particularly fond of that i may have it tomorrow         14.315220078065197
 this was a sad omen of what her mothers behaviour to the gentleman himself might be and elizabeth found that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection and secure of her relations consent there was still something to be wished for         4.5815120427430145
 but the morrow passed off much better than she expected for mrs         13.477585503421436
 bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended soninlaw that she ventured not to speak to him unless it was in her power to offer him any attention or mark her deference for his opinion         5.568453177271872
 elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him and mr         5.283936320034995
 bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem         12.995996979706828
 i admire all my three sonsinlaw highly said he         17.713112308132843
 chapter xviii         14675.902278985472
 elizabeths spirits soon rising to playfulness again she wanted mr         21.588994846231845
 darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her         8.697959406184864
 how could you begin         79.3018700699474
 said she         174.60291386884307
 i can comprehend your going on charmingly when you had once made a beginning but what could set you off in the first place         6.28343777758176
 i cannot fix on the hour or the spot or the look or the words which laid the foundation         9.437659884660084
 it is too long ago         41.80465089966904
 i was in the middle before i knew that i had begun         7.623055628958286
 my beauty you had early withstood and as for my mannersmy behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not         5.376494800549197
 now be sincere did you admire me for my impertinence         18.280744622830657
 for the liveliness of your mind i did         26.21285069597772
 it was very little less         30.190767834279928
 the fact is that you were sick of civility of deference of officious attention         8.53994212919538
 you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking and thinking for your approbation alone         8.984317109195707
 i roused and interested you because i was so unlike them         11.300743444940524
 had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself your feelings were always noble and just and in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you         4.421082357428905
 therei have saved you the trouble of accounting for it and really all things considered i begin to think it perfectly reasonable         10.407172442752845
 to be sure you knew no actual good of mebut nobody thinks of that when they fall in love         7.601250889262421
 was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane while she was ill at netherfield         7.581551031165791
 dearest jane         1746.8763408025632
 who could have done less for her         23.172289593639235
 but make a virtue of it by all means         13.794398087850372
 my good qualities are under your protection and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible and in return it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last         4.32919231252767
 what made you so shy of me when you first called and afterwards dined here         7.8540276467552825
 why especially when you called did you look as if you did not care about me         6.682896969917529
 because you were grave and silent and gave me no encouragement         12.739886694220118
 but i was embarrassed         42.24266155560293
 and so was i         32.07748242551768
 you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner         10.112321903903243
 a man who had felt less might         24.144387685789052
 but i wonder how long you would have gone on if you had been left to yourself         7.667197904183238
 i wonder when you would have spoken if i had not asked you         9.079967319995507
 my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect         8.278248047593127
 too much i am afraid for what becomes of the moral if our comfort springs from a breach of promise for i ought not to have mentioned the subject         5.240371562098666
 this will never do         105.73643463242435
 you need not distress yourself         60.3143087919885
 the moral will be perfectly fair         44.709391592702374
 lady catherines unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts         17.698526193105018
 i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude         8.384797212177808
 i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of yours         7.7487739472985915
 my aunts intelligence had given me hope and i was determined at once to know every thing         11.014277545260189
 lady catherine has been of infinite use which ought to make her happy for she loves to be of use         7.888756363000189
 but tell me what did you come down to netherfield for         13.07661081190559
 was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed         12.345692591591218
 or had you intended any more serious consequence         15.29844458828763
 my real purpose was to see you and to judge if i could whether i might ever hope to make you love me         7.468221188302962
 my avowed one or what i avowed to myself was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley and if she were to make the confession to him which i have since made         4.967769260400364
 shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to befall her         9.211174534579634
 i am more likely to want time than courage elizabeth         14.597974609693562
 but it ought to be done and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done directly         5.338346274814012
 and if i had not a letter to write myself i might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing as another young lady once did         4.36730981126538
 but i have an aunt too who must not be longer neglected         9.370707479475778
 from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr         17.746414291750646
 darcy had been overrated elizabeth had never yet answered mrs         13.438084163282806
 gardiners long letter but now having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness and immediately wrote as follows i would have thanked you before my dear aunt as i ought to have done for your long kind satisfactory detail of particulars but to say the truth i was too cross to write         4.4787707614277705
 you supposed more than really existed         40.23368692325591
 but now suppose as much as you chuse give a loose to your fancy indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford and unless you believe me actually married you cannot greatly err         5.175989315647272
 you must write again very soon and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last         5.618807455334984
 i thank you again and again for not going to the lakes         6.186419284502764
 how could i be so silly as to wish it         12.448870912444237
 your idea of the ponies is delightful         22.08995626387042
 we will go round the park every day         23.98115836417947
 i am the happiest creature in the world         8.346498030116575
 perhaps other people have said so before but not one with such justice         14.278359095847264
 i am happier even than jane she only smiles i laugh         19.72722549709788
 you are all to come to pemberley at christmas         13.35216039197718
 darcys letter to lady catherine was in a different style and still different from either was what mr         8.086858449078523
 collins in reply to his last         39.8911519723003
 dear sir i must trouble you once more for congratulations         15.14594994336367
 elizabeth will soon be the wife of mr         14.205054226230718
 console lady catherine as well as you can         42.74059996637574
 but if i were you i would stand by the nephew         8.82411377299982
 he has more to give         42.56769433050171
 yours sincerely c         5809.565564443387
 miss bingleys congratulations to her brother on his approaching marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere         11.295719382554676
 jane was not deceived but she was affected and though feeling no reliance on her could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved         5.644038570199771
 the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information was as sincere as her brothers in sending it         7.508461735969184
 four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister         8.18156166180209
 before any answer could arrive from mr         34.92711408715327
 collins or any congratulations to elizabeth from his wife the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge         6.877835898315406
 the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident         9.914307009095356
 lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephews letter that charlotte really rejoicing in the match was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over         6.101629659479536
 at such a moment the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought when she saw mr         4.308919590133589
 darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband         12.967394075596669
 he bore it however with admirable calmness         29.466874533837863
 he could even listen to sir william lucas when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st         5.36145324494321
 jamess with very decent composure         78.33934192475537
 if he did shrug his shoulders it was not till sir william was out of sight         7.2655091815036785
 philipss vulgarity was another and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance and though mrs         15.380813471995927
 nor was her respect for him though it made her more quiet at all likely to make her more elegant         6.70153960738343
 elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either and was ever anxious to keep him to herself and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure it added to the hope of the future and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley         4.174924146618188
 chapter xix         14675.902278985472
 happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs         10.62148592467348
 bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters         32.24379276929952
 with what delighted pride she afterwards visited mrs         23.00126140236697
 bingley and talked of mrs         50.85231032280909
 i wish i could say for the sake of her family that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible amiable wellinformed woman for the rest of her life though perhaps it was lucky for her husband who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly         3.419793072210107
 bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do         7.293241389735525
 he delighted in going to pemberley especially when he was least expected         10.30305561673868
 bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth         13.68412612288378
 so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper or her affectionate heart         6.238803735921582
 the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire and jane and elizabeth in addition to every other source of happiness were within thirty miles of each other         5.790118521828673
 kitty to her very material advantage spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters         5.839754560236996
 she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia and removed from the influence of lydias example she became by proper attention and management less irritable less ignorant and less insipid         4.908978178270804
 from the farther disadvantage of lydias society she was of course carefully kept and though mrs         8.366623862905794
 bennets being quite unable to sit alone         41.36188497722187
 mary was obliged to mix more with the world but she could still moralize over every morning visit and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters beauty and her own it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance         4.960159010470568
 he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her and in spite of every thing was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune         4.6107177551187695
 the letter was to this effect my dear lizzy i wish you joy         7.545130566770927
 if you love mr         111.21634312236391
 darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham you must be very happy         6.352458366402599
 it is a great comfort to have you so rich and when you have nothing else to do i hope you will think of us         4.3426882002019225
 i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help         5.445003512424528
 any place would do of about three or four hundred a year but however do not speak to mr         8.05581221396217
 darcy about it if you had rather not         17.270182721309705
 as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind         5.640225658445244
 such relief however as it was in her power to afford by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences she frequently sent them         5.362106023793897
 it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants and heedless of the future must be very insufficient to their support and whenever they changed their quarters either jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills         4.685885471302321
 their manner of living even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home was unsettled in the extreme         6.666007601095651
 they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation and always spending more than they ought         6.138942821417122
 his affection for her soon sunk into indifference hers lasted a little longer and in spite of her youth and her manners she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her         4.158120242925347
 lydia was occasionally a visitor there when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long that even bingleys good humour was overcome and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone         4.860534904513136
 miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcys marriage but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley she dropt all her resentment was fonder than ever of georgiana almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth         4.959886666618128
 pemberley was now georgianas home and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see         7.78878004674789
 they were able to love each other even as well as they intended         11.206698612291824
 georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively sportive manner of talking to her brother         4.59522026146955
 he who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection she now saw the object of open pleasantry         6.29253832639912
 her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way         12.723743991363126
 by elizabeths instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself         6.461273031736828
 but at length by elizabeths persuasion he was prevailed on to overlook the offence and seek a reconciliation and after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt her resentment gave way either to her affection for him or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley in spite of that pollution which its woods had received not merely from the presence of such a mistress but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city         3.958308827490901
 darcy as well as elizabeth really loved them and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who by bringing her into derbyshire had been the means of uniting them         5.154652108090713
